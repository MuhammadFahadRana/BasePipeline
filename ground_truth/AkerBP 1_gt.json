    "What's really making this well remarkable isn't just the fact that we're finding a lot of oil. It's how we're finding it. We are drilling ultra long reservoir sections using advanced geosteering to map the subsurface as we go along with unprecedented accuracy to pinpoint the oil accumulation with high confidence. This isn't just a regular well, this is a huge leap forward in how we explore. We're currently drilling the fourth lateral on the Omega Alpha well in the Idrisil area. We're targeting several structures, the Omega, the Alpha, Alpha South, Sigma Northeast and P. Right now we're steering the wells towards the Sigma Northeast and the P structures. And things are looking really good. We're drilling in about ten meters of oil, a good indication that we are exactly where we should be. We are currently geosteering the well, which means that we are placing the well optimally in the reservoir. Normally we are doing that to optimize the production well, but in this case we are drilling an exploration well and we are optimizing the well to optimize the data acquisition. We are collecting massive amount of data with this well, probably more than has ever been collected before in an exploration well. This data will significantly reduce the subsurface uncertainty. The Omega and Alpha well are a continuation of the work we started two years ago with Østfriik. There we went from exploration drilling to development in just two years. Geological this is very similar to Østfriik. We are seeing a thin oil column trapped beneath an intra-reservoir shale. In this setting, an efficient seal for hydrocarbons. Two years ago with the Østfriik well, we set a new benchmark in exploration, achieving more than 13 kilometers of reservoir exposure. A year later on Frigamma GeoPilot, we further pushed the limits and drilled length and ROP versus hole cleaning. Since then we've gotten the best performing rig in the market back on contract. We have done several performance improving upgrades and equipped the rig with wire pipe. This puts us in a position to not only push the limits but making a step change in performance. We started off drilling the longest well ever drilled in Norway with the standard exploration well design and we did it following the low flow and high ROP strategy. We have debunked several old drilling practices and proved the technical limit is still to be reached. This is only the beginning and I look forward to continue pushing the limits for what's technically feasible while drilling a well. AKBP is a perfect match for Dipsy Stavanger. They have ambition goals and push limits. Every single day our team delivers safely, securely and at world-class level. With the upgrades made for the AKBP contract, Dipsy Stavanger has become an even sharper drilling machine. We look forward for many great years ahead with new milestones, new records and a continued focus on safety, quality and collaboration. Being part of this operation has been a true pleasure. Simply just showing performance first put into action. Thanks to Oddfjell and Halliburton and the good collaboration of Offshore we are able to do this and not to mention the great planning and support from our Onshore team. With their high quality engineering, constantly pushing boundaries and willingness to take risk, we are able to deliver world-class results as one team. This group is led by Take Spindle, behind me absently."
