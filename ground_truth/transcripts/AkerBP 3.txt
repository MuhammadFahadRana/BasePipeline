 We've been working with the case tree that's connected to root cause analysis and we've been working more in the risk management part. So basically what we are doing is to create some chatbot assistants to help people that are offshore when they have to conduct some sort of risk assessment. So the general idea is just to create these assistants and allow an offshore operator to ask questions related to any activities that they can perform and then get some guidance as well ideas of outreach risks they might face. We have been tackling the problem of cause analysis using an AI assistant. Basically what it means is assisting operators and people who are investigating issues with documents that have been gathered from multiple sources and making use of the data that is at hand with them at fast record pace. I have worked in a cross-functional team with representatives from across RKBP, Cognite and Microsoft. Over the last two weeks, we've been working on this case or the design verification together with Microsoft and Cognite and also Acro Solutions in our team. What we have done was to create a chat interface with the specification the STF 101 which is being used to design and verify our pipelines. This chatbot has the ability to answer questions about the content that is in that document. And this can help people to understand better what information to find within that specification. There are several tasks that are being explored. One of them is to be able to interrogate the code via a chatbot to identify various requirements in the sign code. And then the second task is to look into if we can challenge the chatbot to give us an answer to if an existing design or a pipeline in operation is in compliance with the requirements of the code. I'm here joining the RKBP hackathon in the use case regarding offshore rotation planning. We're working on a problem that has existed for many years where offshore rotation planning, a complex problem, is mainly tackled manually with a lot of resources and human input required. And we're trying to use LLMs to help us create an algorithm that automatically finds the best solution to the problem of staffing. I think it brings a very interesting dynamic, and it forces people to really prioritize what they want to achieve and bring a meaningful result at the end of the day. Thank you. I think it's been really valuable to have people from Cognite, Microsoft and Acura Solutions on the team with us at this hackathon, working hands-on, implementing the technology and this proof of concept. Acura PPE's digital strategy is all based on the ecosystem and for the last two days we've gathered our software partners, Cognite and Microsoft, our service provider Teato Avery, Acura Solutions and people across departments in Acura PPE to come together for a two-day hackathon on how we can apply GenAI to the business. The results have been fantastic. The cross-company collaboration has been excellent and the cross-functional domain and digital experts working together to actually get something done. It has been truly fantastic. It's been a great enthusiastic gang and the next stage now is to get it done. We're looking forward to prove out how quick we can go from idea to production. Stay tuned.
