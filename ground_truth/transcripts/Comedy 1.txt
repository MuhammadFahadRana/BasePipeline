 The English language was created by English people. I don't know when, but we decided to get letters to form words so we can communicate. But we also decided to sprinkle, for no apparent reason, letters within these words. They're silent. Shhh! Forever. Why? Why? Like the word hour, for example. Why is the word hour spelt with an H? Why is there an H? The silent H! Nobody has ever said, I'll see you in a hour. I'll see you in a hour. I'm just going to pick up the sandwich. I'll be back in a hour. Half a hour. Half, even half, has an L in it. Half. Half a hour. How long is the journey? About half a hour to a hour. The sandwich shop is half a hour away. It's a waste of everybody's time. The word subtle. Would anybody object if it was subtle? S-U-T-L-E? Not a single person would. But there's a B in the middle going, shhh, just ignore me. Just ignore me for a minute. I'm silent. I'm left here, left behind. I don't know, I was destined for another word, baboon, but here I am with the N. How I long to be in the word baboon where I have a purpose. Like all those words that should begin with N, but have a K. Of all the letters that... Why would a K be silent? Knickers. Why is it knickers? Knuckles. Knuckles. So I've been thinking about this, as you can probably tell, and I think we should have a day. We should have a day. Silent letter day. Where we all come out to play. It would be on a wednesday. A wednesday. Sometime in the autumn. In the autumn. In the autumn. In the autumn. Could be in February. I haven't put on a silver tie. Could be in February. Or the autumn. And we'll spend the day together. Families together. Talking, talking. And walking. We'll go for walks. And climbing. Climbing. Climbing. Climbing. Knitting. A lot of knitting. People will save up their knitting to do on silent letter day. And the knife is the only cutlery that you're allowed to use. The knife. No other cutlery is allowed on silent letter day. Food is buffet style. Buffet style. You go along with your knife. There's salmon. And swordfish. And sandwiches. And yoghurt. Yoghurt. Yoghurt. And you use your knife. All the flavours are very subtle. Very subtle flavours. And the gnome. Will be the symbol of silent letter day. My father at Christmas. The gnome. Everybody gives each other a gnome to celebrate. Happy silent letter day. I got you a gnome. I kept it hidden in the cupboard for months. I whorrapped it up. Do you like it? I whorrapped it up. I cut the whorrapping paper with scissors. I used scissors. For my little whorrapping paper. I'm so sorry. I forgot. I didn't realise. Is it really silent letter day? Is it honestly? Is it honestly silent letter day? You mean honestly? Yes, it is honestly. You should have a gnome. You're a nevernister. You're a nevernister. I'm not giving you a gnome. I'm sorry. I'm taking it back to the shop. I've kept the receipt. I've kept the receipt. And at the end of the day. My father at Christmas. And at the end of the day, we will celebrate with champagne. We'll have you some champagne. Happy San Alete Day. Just a drop. Maybe just a splash. Oh, there's a knock at the door. Oh, it's Chloe and Isla. Sorry, it's Chloe and Isla. My old friends from school. Friends from school. Fascinating. Grab a knife. Help yourself to lasagna. This is lasagna. And at the end of the day, when we are knackered, we go to sleep at half past the hour.
