  "text": "running how are you it's been great hasn't that's been a been blown away by the whole thing in fact i'm leaving there are being three themes have they're running through the conference which i read a relevant to what i want to talk about one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and then all the people here just have worked in the variety ah in the range of it the second is that it's put isn't a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of future no idea how this may plans i have an interest in education actually what i find this everybody has an interest in education don't you i find it very interesting if you to did it at a dinner party and you say you work in education actually you're not often at dinner parties frankly hit for think if you're working as yes you know fast and and you'll never asked back curiously that's a restructuring but if you are and you say to somebody knows what do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face and oh my god you know why me and it's my one night i have a week but if you ask about their education a pin huge the all good it's one of those things are goes deep with people am i right and like religion and money in other things so i have a big interest education i think we all do we have a huge vested interest it partly because it's education that meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp if you think of it children starting school this year will be retiring in twenty sixty five nobody has a clue despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years' time and yet we're meant to be educating them for it so the unpredictability i think is extraordinary and the third part of this is that we've all agreed nonetheless on the really extraordinary capacities that children have that capacity for innovation a means to reno last night was a marvel wasn't she'd just seeing what she could do and she's exceptional but i think she's not so to speak exceptional in the whole of of childhood what you have those a person of extorted education and find a talent and my contention is all kids have tremendous talents and we squander them pretty ruthless a so i want to talk about education and i want to talk about creativity my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status take you that was it and then i think you and so so fifteen minutes left when i was born know the i had a great story recently i love telling it of a little girl who was in a during this and she was six inches of the back during and that the teacher said this little girl how ever paid attention and in the store english and she did and the teacher was fast that she went over to and she said what are you drawing and the girl said i'm drawing a picture of god and the teacher said but nobody knows what god looks like and the girl said they would in a minute when when my son was for in england actually who's for everyone to be honest i'm in for the strict about it where everyone it was for here but he was in the nativity play to of the story no it's biggest big story mel gibson that the sequel the most out of nativity to but term james got the part of joseph which we are thrilled about we consider this be one of the lead parts the place crammed full of agents and t church know james robinson is joseph we had they didn't have to speak but you are the bit where the three kings come in now they're coming bearing gifts and they bring gold frankincense and myrrh this really happened with sitting there and they i think just went out of sequence because we talk to the laughed with and said you know the okay with this idea why was i wrong that just switched and it was it and you the three boys came in little for i was with tea towels on their heads and they put these boxes down the first boy said i bring you gold and the second boer said i bring you mare and the third boy said frank sent this if what these things have in common is that kids will take a chance if they don't know they'll have a go am i right they're not frightened of being wrong now i don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing is being creative what we do know is of you're not prepared to be wrong you will never come up with anything original if you're not prepared to be wrong and by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity they have become frightened of being wrong and we run our companies this by the way we stigmatized mistakes and now running national education systems were mistakes are the worst thing you can make and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities picasso one sent this he said that all children are born artist the problem must remain an artist as we grow up i believe this passionately that we don't grow into creativity we grow out of it or rather we get education at it so why is this if i lived in stratford on a even into about five years ago in fact we move from stratford to los angeles so you can imagine what a seamless transition you know this was from and and i actually willing of highschool snitterfield were just outside stratford which is where shakespeare's father was born are you struck by a new thought i was you don't think of shakespeare having a father do dear because you don't think of shakespeare being a child to shakespeare being seven i never thought of it i mean even just some when he was in somebody is english class wasn't it cheers a how annoying with that may be must try harder them being sent to bed by as so to shakespeare go to bed now you know to william shakespeare in and put the pencil and and stop speaking like that you know it's it's it's confusing everybody anyway we moved from stratford to los angeles and not just on to say what about the transition actually my son didn't want to come up got two kids used twenty well known my daughter's sixteen he didn't want to come to los angeles you loved it but he had a girlfriend in england this that this was the love of his life sarah the he'd known for a month commander that had the fourth anniversary into because it's a long time when you're sixteen january was really upset on the plane he said i'll never find another girl like sarah and we were out the pleased about and frankly because shoes she was the main reason we live in the country but something strikes you when you move to america and when you travel around the world every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects everyone doesn't matter where you go you think it be otherwise but it isn't at the top on mathematics and languages then the humanity isn't the bottom of the arts everywhere on earth and i'm pretty much every system to the as a hierarchy within the arts arts and music are normally given the higher status in schools than drama and dance there isn't an education system on the planet the teachers dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics why why not i think this is rather important i think mats is very important but so is stance toward and done solar time mr lot to will do we all have bodies don't me did i miss a meeting i mean i think trivia what happens is as children grow up we start educating progressive way from the waist up and then we focus on their heads and slightly to one side if you were to visit education as an alien to say what's it for public education i think you'd have to conclude if you look at the output you know who's really succeeds my the shooters haven't they should who gets all a brownie points you know who the winners i think you have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors isn't that the people who come out the top and i used to be one of their inner but and i like university professors but you know we shouldn't tell them up as the that the high water mark of all human achievement that just a form of life dear another form of life but that rather curious and i say this out of affection for them the summit curious about professors in my experience not all of them but typically they live in their heads i live up there and slightly to one side that descend bodied you know in a kind of literal way you know they they look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads you know it's dante it's a way of getting that had to meetings if you want real evidence of out of body experience has been the doing get yourself a to residential conference a senior academics and pop into the disc attack on the final night and there you will see it grown men and women riding uncontrollably off the beat waiting to end so the go and write a paper about it now our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability and there's a reason the whole system was invented round the world there were no public system for education really before the nineteenth century they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism so their hierarchies regional on to ideas number one that the the most useful subjects for worker at the top so you were probably stayed benignly away from things at school when you're a kid things you liked on the ground you would never get a job doing that is that right don't do music you're going to be a musician done to aren't you won't be an artist but nine advice now profoundly mistaken the whole world is engulfed in revolution and the second his academic ability which is really come to dominate our view of intelligence because the university's designed the system in their image if you think about the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance and the consequences that many highly talented brilliant created people think they're not because the thing that we're good at at school wasn't valued or was actually stigmatized and i think we can't afford to go on that way in the next thirty years according to unesco more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history more people and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about technology and it's transformation effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population certainly degrees aren't worth anything is not true when i was a student if you had a degree you had a job if you didn't have a job it's because you didn't want one and i didn't want one but frankly so but now kids were that with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games because you needed an they where the previous job required to be a and now you need a pigsty for the other it's a process of academic inflation and it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet we need to radically we think copy of intelligence we know three things about intended just one it's diverse we think about the world and all the ways that we experience that we think visually we think in sound we think kinda sceptically we think an abstract terms we think in movement secondly intelligence is dynamic if you look at the interactions of a human brain as we had yesterday from number presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive the brain isn't divided into compartments in fact creativity which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value more often than not comes about through the interaction of different discipline new ways of seeing things the brain it's intention by the way there's a shaft of nurse join to do how's the brain called a corpus callosum it's thick it and women falling off from helen yes i think this is probably why women are better at multitasking because you are aren't you that's a raft of research but i know if my personal life if my wife is cooking a meal at home which is not often thankfully but you know if she's a she's now she's got some something but if she's cooking you know she's dealing with people on the phone she's talking to kids she's painting the ceiling you know she's during open heart surgery of here if i'm cooking the door is shut the kids are out the phones on the hook if she comes in i get annoyed i said terry please i'm trying to fry an egg and here if give me a break actually there was a didn't do that oh filled philosophical thing if a tree falls into in a forest and nobody hears it did it happen know that old chestnut us are a great teacher really we recently would said if a man speaks his mind and a forest a nobleman here's in is he still wrong and the third thing about intelligence is it's distinct i'm doing a new book of mom called epiphany which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered that talent i'm fascinated by how people got to be that it's really prompted by conversation i had with a wonderful woman who make most people never had our school julian flynn have you heard of a some have she's a choreographer and everybody knows it works you did cats and phantom of the opera she's wonderful nice to be on the board of the royal ballet in england as you can see and and original had lunch on that's an country to be a dancer and she said it was interesting when she was at school she was really hopeless and the school in the thirties wrote her parents had we think gillian has a learning disorder you couldn't construct fidgeting i think now that i had a d h d wouldn't you but this just the nineteen thirties and eighty actually hadn't been invented this point so it wasn't that available condition you know people people people weren't aware they could have that anyway she sent went to see this this specialist so this oh panel room and and she was that with with her mother and she was let and sat on this chair at the end then she sat on our hands for twenty minutes while this man talked to mother about all the problems jillian was having at school and at the end of it because she was disturbing people that homework was i was late and so a little kid of a in the end the the doctor went and sat next to it in such and i've listened to all these things that mother's told me i need to speak to a privately so she said she said wait here will be back room be very long and and and they went in after but they went out the room he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk and when they got out the room the central mother just stand and watch and the minute they left the room she said she was on their feet moving to the music and they watch for few minutes and he turned to mother and instead you know mrs lynn gillian isn't sick she's a dancer take it to attend school i said what happened said she did i can't tell us how wonderful it was we walked in this room and it was full of people like me people who couldn't sit still people who have to move to think who have to move to think that it ballet that attack that a jazz that it modern a temporary she was eventually auditioned for the royal ballet school she became a soloist had a wonderful create the royal ballet she eventually graduate from the royal ballet school found found her own company the drilling than done company met andrew lloyd webber she's been responsible some they're successful musical theater actions in history she's given pleasure to millions and she's a multimillionaire somebody else might have put on medication until the to calm down now i think what i think it comes to this out or spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by rachel carson i believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstruct our conception of the richness of human capacity our education system has mind our minds in the way that we strip mind the earth for particular commodity and for the future it won't service we have to rethink the fundamental principles on which were educating our children there was a wonderful quote by jonas salk who said if you were to if all the insects were to disappear from the earth within fifty years all life on earth would end if all human beings disappeared from the earth within fifty is all forms of life would flourish and he's right what ted celebrates his the gift of the human imagination we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and the we have vert some of the sinners that we've talked about and the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that the well on our task is to educate the whole being so they can face this future by the way we may not see this future but they will and now job is to help them make something of it thank you very much",
