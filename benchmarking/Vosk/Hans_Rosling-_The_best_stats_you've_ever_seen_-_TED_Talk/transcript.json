  "text": "but ten years ago i took on the task to teach global development to swedish undergraduate students that was after having spent about twenty years together with african institutions studying hunger in africa so i was sort of expected to know a little about the were world and i started in our medical university karolinska institute an undergraduate course called global health but when you get that the opportunity you get a little nervous i thought these students coming to our actually have the highest grade you can get in swedish college system so i thought maybe they know everything i'm going to teach them about so id the pretense just when they came and one of the question from which i learnt a lot was this one which country has the highest childmortality of these five pairs and i put them together so that in each pair of country one has twice the child mortality of the other and this means that and it's much bigger the difference than the uncertainty of the data i won't put you to test here but it's turkey which is high as they are poland russia pakistan and south africa and these weather is shouts of the swedish students i did it so i got a confidence in the world which was pretty narrow and i got happy of course at one point eight right answer after five possible that means that there was a place for a professor of international help and for my course but one like late night when i was compiling the report i really realized my discovery i have shown that swedish top students no statistically significantly less about the world and the chimpanzees because this chimpanzee would score half right if i gave him two bananas with the and turkey they would be right half of the cases but the students are not that the problem for me was not ignorance it was preconceived ideas i did also an unfit unethical study of the professors of the current in games that you that pans out the nobel prize in medicine and they are on par with that chimpanzee there so this is where i realized that there was really need to communicate because the data or what's happening in the world and the child health i'll be a every country's very well aware so we did this software which displays it like this every bubble here is a country the this country over here is daisy's china and these these india the size of the bubble is the population and on this is here i put fertility rate because my students what they said when they looked upon the world and i asked them what do you really think about the world on when i first discovered that the textbook was tintin mainly and and they said the world is still we and them and we is western world and them his third world and what do you mean with western world i said well that's long life in small family and third world is short life in large family so this is what they could display here i put fertility rate here number of children per woman one two three four up to about eight children per woman we have very good data since nineteen sixty two nineteen sixty about on the size of families in the world country the error margin is narrow here i put life expectancy at birth from thirty years in some come freeze up to about seventy years and nineteen sixty two that was really a group of countries hear that was industrialized countries and they had smaller families and long lives and these were the developing countries they had large families and they had relatively short lives now what has happened since nineteen sixty two we want to see the change of the students right it's still two types of countries or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here where have they got longer lives and live up there let's see we stop the world and this is all you and statistic that has been available here we go can you see that it china am moving against better healthcare improving their or the green latin american countries they are moving toward smaller families your yellow ones here are the arabic countries then they get large families but they no longer life but not larger families the africans or the green down here they still remain here these is india indonesia has moving on pdfs and in the eighties here you have bangladesh still among the african countries there but now bangladesh it's a miracle that happens in the eighties the me mom start to promote family planning and they move up into that corner and in nineties we have the terrible hiv epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the african countries and all the rest of the mall moves up into the corner where we have long lives and small family and we have a completely new world help me make a comparison directly between united states of america and vietnam nineteen sixty four america huh small families and long life vietnam had large families and short lives and this is what happens the data during the war indicate that even with all the debt that was an improvement of life expectancy by the end of the year the family planning started in vietnam and they went for smaller families and the united states up there is getty for longer life keeping family size and in the eighties now they give up communist planning and they go for market economy and it moves fast that even then social life and today we have in vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in vietnam ninety two thousand and three as a new and i it states nineteen seventy four by the end of the war i think we all if we don't look in the date that we underestimate the tremendous change in asia which was in social change before we saw the economic and change so let's move over to another way here in which we could display the does did you shun in the world of the income this is the world distribution of income or people one dollar ten dollar or one hundred dollars per day that's no gap between rich and poor and the along this is a myth that's a little hundred pm but that people all the way and if we look where the income ends up the income this is one hundred percent the world's annual income and the riches twenty percent they take out of that about seventy four percent and the poorest twenty percent they take about two percent and these shows that the concept developing countries is extremely adult for we sort of think about aid like these people here giving aid to these people here but in the middle we have most the world population and they have now twenty four percent of income we heard it in other forms and who are who are these these were all the different countries i can show you africa this is africa can present the world population most in poverty this is always c d the rich conquered the country club of the un and they are over here on this side and the quite an overlap between africa and always cd and this is latin america it has everything on this earth from the poorest to the richest in latin america and on top of that we can put east europe we can put east asia and we could south asia and how did it look like if we go back in time to about nineteen seventy then there was more about hump and we have most to lived in absolute poverty were asians the problem in the world was the poverty in asia and if i now let the world move forward you would seem that wild population increase there are hundreds of millions in asia getting out of poverty and some others get into poverty and this is the pet and we have today and the best projection from the world bank is that this will happen and we will not have a divided world we we have most people in the middle of course it's a logarithmic scale here but the concept of economy is growth with percent will look up on the as a possibility of percentage increase if i change these and i take gdp per capita instead of family income and i turn turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product and i take the region's down here the size of the bubble still the population and you have to always see the they are and you have sub saharan africa there and we take off the arab states they're coming both from africa and from asia and we put them separately and we can expand these access and i can give it a new dimension here by adding the social values they shine survive and now i have money on that access and i have the possibility of children to survive there in some countries ninety nine point seven percent of children survived to five years of age others on the seventy and here it seems that east get between always see the latin america east europe east asia arab states south asia and sub saharan africa the linear it is very strong between child survival and money but let me split sub saharan africa else is there and better it is up there i can go here and i can split sub saharan africa into it's countries and when it burst the size obese company bubble is the size of the population sierra leone the down there more reaches up there my reaches was the first country to get away with trade barriers and they could sell they sugar they could sell their text styles on equal terms as the people in europe and north america there's a huge difference between africa and gone as here in the middle in sierra leone the humanitarian aid here in a uganda development aid here time to invest their you can go for holiday the tremendous variation with in africa which we rarely often make that it's equal everything i can split south asia here in guess the big bubble in the middle but huge difference between afghanistan and sri lanka and i guess bit arab states holiday same climate same culture same religion huge difference even between neighbors yemen civil war united arab emirates money which was quite equally and well use not as the myth is and that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country data is often better than you think many people say that data days bad there's an uncertainty march but we can see the difference here cambodia singapore the differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data east europe soviet economy for a long time but they come out of the ten years very very differently and there's latin america today we don't have to go to cuba to find a healthy country in latin america chain that we'll have a lower child mortality in cuba with in some few years from now and here we have high income countries in obesity and we get the whole pet and here of the world which is more or less like like this and if we look at it how it looks the world in nineteen sixty it starts to move nineteen six if this is meltzer to and he brought health to china and then he died and then deng xiaoping came member of money to china and brought them into the mainstream again and we have seen how companies are in different directions like this so it's sort of sort of difficult to go get an example come to be shows the pet pattern of the world but i would like to bring you back to about here at nineteen sixty and i would like to compare south korea which is this one with with brazil which is this one the label went away for me here and i would like to compare uganda which is there and i can run it for would like this and you can see how south korea is making a very very fast advancement whereas brazil is much slower and if we move back again here and we put on trails on them like this you can see again that the speed of development is very very different and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health but it seems you can move much faster if the are healthy first then if you are wealthy first and to show that you can put on the way of united arab emirates they came from here a mineral contrary they catch all the oil they got all the money but health cannot be bought at the supermarket you have to invest in help you have to get kids into school in you have to train health staff you have to educate the population and shake say i did that in a fairly good way and the in spite of falling oil prices he brought this country up here so we got them much more mainstream appeal there and of the world where all countries tend to use them money better than they used in the past now this is more or less if you look at if you look at average data of the countries they are like this now that's dangerous to use average data because there's such a lot of differences within countries so if i go and look here we can see that yeah uganda that today is where south korea was nineteen sixty if i split uganda there's quite a difference with in uganda these are the quintiles of uganda the richest twenty percent of ugandan saw their the poorest are down there if i split south africa it's like this and if i go down and look at nigeria where there was such a terrible famine lastly is like this the twenty percent poorest of nigeria is out here and the twenty percent richest of south africa is there and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in africa everything in this world existing africa and you can't discuss universal access to hiv for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here the improvement of the world must be highly contextualize and it's not relevant to have it on regional level we much be much more detail we find that students get very excited when they can use this and even more policymakers and the corporate sector would like to see see how the world is changing know why doesn't this take place why are we not using the date that we have we have data in the united nations in the national statistical agencies and in universities in other nongovernmental organization because the data is hidden down in the databases and the public is there and the internet is there but we have still not used effectively all that the information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics are some web pages like this you know but they take some nourishment down from the database bases but people put prices on them stupid passwords and boring statistics this won't work so what is needed we have the database is it's not a new database you need we have wonderful designed to some more and more i ended up here so we started a nonprofit venture which we called linking data to design we call it gapminder from london underground by they warn your mind the guy yep so we have gapminder was appropriate and we started to write software which could link the data like this and it wasn't that difficult it took some person years and we have produced animations you can take a data set them put it there we're liberating you and data some few you and organization some countries except that their databases can go out on the world but what we really need is of course a search function as search function where we can copy the data up to search of informant and get it out in the world and what do we hear when we go around i've done anthropology on the main statistical you and it's everyone says is impossible this can't be dumb our information is so peculiar and deacon so that cannot be searched as other can be search we cannot give the data free to the students free to then for printers of the world but this is what we would like to see isn't it the publicly funded data is down here and we would like flowers to grow up on the net and one of the crucial point is to make them search herbal and them people can use the different design to to animated there and i have a pretty good news for you have a good news that the press and new head of you and statistic he doesn't say it's impossible here when this as we can't do it and that's quite clever guy so we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years we will be able to look at the income distributions in completely new ways this is the income distribution of china nineteen seventy this is the income distribution of the united states nineteen seventy or most no overlap almost no overlap and what has happened what does happen is this the china's growing it's not so equal any longer and it's appearing here or where to look in the united states almost like a ghost isn't it it's pretty scary but i think it's very important to have have all this information we need we need really to see it and instead of looking at this i would like to end up by showing the internet users per one thousand and this software we access about five hundred variables from all the countries quite easily it takes some time to to to change for this but on the axis is you can quite easily get any buried but you would like to have and the thing would be to get up the database is free to get them search been and with the second clique to get them into the graphic formats where you can instant them the understand that mother statisticians doesn't like it because they say that this will not this will not a show the that reality we have to have statistical analytic and me if if it's but this is hypotheses generating i and now with the world they're the internet are calming the number of internet users are going up like this this is the gdp per capita and he's a new technology coming in but the and amazingly how well it fits to the economy of the country's that's why they're one hundred dollar computer will be so important but it's a nice tenders it's is as if the world is for latin me off isn't that these companies are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to fall of this over the year as i would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data thank you very much",
