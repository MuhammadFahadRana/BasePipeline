  "text": "i'm the luckiest guy in the world i got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world i was in india this past year and i may have seen the last cases of polio in the world there's nothing that makes you feel more the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that than to know that something that horrible no longer exists so i'm going to touch some i show you some dirty pictures they are difficult to watch but you should look at them with optimism because the horror of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exists the first i'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey my background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect when i was an intern san francisco i was i heard about a group of native americans were taken over alcatraz island than a native american who wanted to give birth on that island and no other doctor wanted to go and helper give birth i went out to alcatraz and i lived on the island for several weeks she gave birth i caught the baby i got off the island i landed in san francisco and all the press wanted to talk to me because my three weeks on the island may be an expert in indian affairs i wound up on every television show someone saw me on television they called me up and the ask me if i'd like to be in the movie and the play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling and a bus ride from san francisco to england i said yes i would do that so i became the doctor and actually awful movie called medicine ball caravan you know from the sixties you're either around the bus your off the bus i was on the boss my wife and i have thirty seven years join the bus hour bus ride took us from san francisco to london we switch purses at the big pond we we we then got on to more buses and we drove through turkey and iran afghanistan over the khyber pass into pakistan like every other young doctor this is us at the khyber pass and that's of us we had some difficulty getting over the khyber pass but we wound up in india and then like everyone else in our generation we went to live in a himalayan monastery this is just like a residency program for those of you that medical school and we studied with a wise man girl named curly baba who then told me to get rid of the dress put on a three piece suit go join the united nations as a diplomat and work for the world health organization and he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated in this was god's gift to humanity because of the hard work of dedicated scientists and that prediction came true and this little girl is rahima bano and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world and this document is the certificate that the global commission signed certifying the world to eradicated the first disease in history the key to eradicate smallpox was early detection early response i'm going to ask you to repeat that early detection early response can you say that early detection early response smallpox was the worst disease in history it killed more people than all the wars in history in the last century it killed five hundred million people more than two you you're reading about larry page or a somebody reads very fast in the year that larry page and sergei brin with whom i have a certain affection and a new affiliation in the year in which they were born two million people died of smallpox we do smallpox eradicated in nineteen eighty this is the most important slide that i've ever seen in public health because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest to be kings and queens of the world did not protect you from dying smallpox never can you doubt that we are all in this together but to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective you should see it from the perspective of mother watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly day one day two day three day four day five day six your mother and you're watching your child and on day six you see postures that become hard day seven they show the classic scars of smallpox and bill occasion day eight and al gore said earlier that the most photographed image in the world the most printed image in the world was that of the earth but this was in nineteen seventy four and as of that moment this photograph was the photograph that was that was widely printed because we printed two billion copies of this photograph and we took them hand to hand door to door to show people and asked them if there was smallpox in their house because that was our surveillance is and we didn't have google we didn't have web crawlers we didn't have computers by day nine you look at this picture and your horrified i look at this picture and i say thank god because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox and i know this child will live and by thirteen the thirteen the lesions scabbing his eyelids or swell and but you know this child has no other secondary infection and by day twenty while he will be scarred for life he will live there are the kinds of smallpox that are not like that this is confluence smallpox in which there isn't a single place on the body will you could put a finger and that be covered by lesions flat smallpox which killed one hundred percent of people who got it and hemorrhagic smallpox the most cruel of all which had a predict predilection for pregnant women are proud we had fifty women die they all had hemorrhagic smallpox i've never seen anybody die from it wasn't pregnant woman nineteen sixty seven the wh show embarked and what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease in that year there were thirty four countries affected with smallpox by nineteen seventy we're down to eighteen countries nineteen seventy four we're down to five countries but in that year smallpox exploded throughout india and india was the place where smallpox made it's last stand and nineteen seventy four india had a population of six hundred million their twenty one linguistic states in india which is like saying twenty one different countries the to twenty million people on the road at any time and buses and trains walking five hundred thousand villages one hundred and twenty million households and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity sheikh amar the cooling mother and it was wrong to bring strangers in your house when the deity was in the house no incentive to report smallpox wasn't just india that had smallpox deity smallpox to you these were prevalent all over the world so how we eradicated smallpox was max vaccination wouldn't work you could vaccinate everybody in india but one year later the be twenty one million new babies which was then the population of canada it wouldn't do just to vaccinate every to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time and draw a circle of immunity around it and that's what we did in india alone my hundred and fifty thousand and best friends and i went door to door with that same picture to every single house and india you made over one billion house calls and in the process i learned something very important every time we did a house to house search we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox when we didn't search we had the illusion that there was no disease when we did search we had the illusion that there was more disease a surveillance system was necessary because what we needed was early detection early response so we searched and we searched and we found every case of smallpox in india we had a reward we raise the reward we continue to increase the reward we had a score card that we wrote and every house and as we did that the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero and in nineteen eighty we declared the globe free of smallpox it was the largest campaign in united nations history until the iraq war one hundred and fifty thousand people from all over the world doctors of every race religion culture and nation who fought side by side brothers and sisters with each other not against each other in a common cause to make the world better but smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication we failed three other times we failed against malaria yellow fever and yards but soon we may see polio eradicated but the key to eradicating polio early detection early response this may be the year we eradicate polio that will make it the second disease in history and david heyman who's watching this on the webcast david keep on going we're close we're down to four countries i feel like hank aaron barry bonds can replace me any time let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about i was just in india working on the polio program the polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door that is the surveillance system but we need to have early detection early response blindness the same thing the key to this discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness so you can mount the perp the correct response the seva foundation was started by a group of alumni i have the smallpox eradication program who having climb the highest mountain tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating and disease wanted to do it again and over the last twenty seven years save his programs and fifteen countries have given back site to more than two million blind people seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue blindness which heretofore been thought of only as a clinical disease nineteen eighty ninety eighty steve jobs gave me that computer which is apple number twelve and it still in katmandu and still working and where to go get it in oxnard off and make more money for saver and we conducted the first nepal survey ever done for health and the first nationwide blindness serve ever done we had astonishing results instead of finding out what we thought was the case the blindness was cause mostly by glaucoma into a coma we were astounded to find out that blindness was cause instead by catterick you can't cure or prevent we you don't know is there in you ted packages this a dvd infinite vision about doctor v and they are of and i hospital i hope that you will take a look at it our of in which started as a save a project is now the world's largest and best i hospital this year that one hospital will give back site to more than three hundred thousand people in tamil nadu hello representative vol terrible things this might be the worst the key to preventing were mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response we will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an anti viral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years wh or stages the progress of a pandemic we are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage with just a little bit of human to human transmission but no human to human to human sustain transmission the moment wh oh says we've moved to category for this will not be like katrina the world as we know it i'll stop the be no airplanes flying would you get an airplane with two hundred and fifty people you didn't know coughing and sneezing when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you for which you had no anti virus or vaccine i did a study of the top epidemiologist in the world in october i asked them these are off flu our just and specialists in influence and i ask them questions you'd like to ask them what do you think the likelihood is that the be a pandemic if it happens how bad you think it'll be fifteen percent said they thought they'd be a pandemic within three years but much worse than that ninety percent said they thought they'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime and they thought that if there was a pandemic a billion people would get sick as many as one hundred and sixty five million people would die there would be a global recession and depression as i just in time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for every one than merely a one hundred million people dying because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits that the consequences are almost unthinkable and it's getting worse because travel is getting so much better let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like so we know what we're talking about let's assume for example the first case occurs in south asia it's initially goes quite slowly you get two or three discreet locations then they'll be secondary outbreaks and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you with in three weeks it will be everywhere in the world now if we had an undo button and we could go back and isolated and grab it when it first started if we could find it early and we had early detection early response and we could put each one of those viruses in jail that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic let me show you why that is we we have a joke this is an epidemic curve and everyone in medicine i think ultimately gets to know what it is but the joke is an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve but you don't get to do that usually usually arrive right about here what we really want is to arrive right here so we can stop the epidemic but you can't always do that but there's an organization that has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur and that is called g finn it's the global public health information network and that simulate one that i showed you that you thought was bird flu that was sars and sars is the pandemic that did not occur and it didn't occur because chief and found the epidemic of pant the the pandemic to be of sars three months before wh show actually announced it and because of that we were able to stop the sars pandemic and i think we owe a great debt of gratitude to g finn and iran st john who i hope is in the audience someplace over there who is the founder of g hello and ted has flown around here from ottawa which even is located because not only did you even find sars early but you may have seen last week that iran announced that they had bird flu in iran but chief and found the bird flu in iran that february fourteenth but last september we need an early warning system to protect us against the things that are humanities worst nightmare and so my head wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences smallpox early detection early response line polio early detection early response pandemic bird flu early detection early response it is a litany it is so obvious that are only way of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early and to kill them before they spread so my ted wish is for you to help build a global system an early warning system to protect us against humanity is worst nightmares and what i thought i would call it his early detection but it should really be called total early detection right what but in all seriousness because this idea is birth in ted i would like it to be a legacy of ted and i'd like to call it the international system for total early disease detection and instead then becomes our mantra so instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu we find it and immediately contain it instead of a novel virus caused by bio terror or bio error or shift or drift we find it and we contain it instead of industrial accidents like oil spills with the catastrophe in bhopal we find them and we respond to them instead of famine hidden until it is too late we detected and we respond and instead of a system which is owned by a government and the hidden in the bowels of government let's build an early detection system that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language let's make a transparent non governmental not owned by any single country or company host in a neutral country with redundant back up in a different time zone and a different continent and let's build it on jeevan let's start with jeevan let's increase the website that they crawl from twenty thousand to twenty million let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to seventy or more let's build an outbound confirmation messages using text messages or sms or instant messaging to find out from people who are within one hundred meters of the rumor that you hear if it is in fact valid and let's add satellite confirmation and will add gap minders amazing graphics to the front and and will grow it as a moral force in the world finding out those terrorists of things before anybody else knows about him and sending our response to them so that next year instead of us meeting here lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world we will have pulled together use the unique skills and the magic of this community and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics other catastrophes and change the world beginning right now huh an amazing presentation festival just so ever understand usa that by built it by creating web crawlers looking on the internet for patterns we could they can detect something suspicious before whr before anyone else can see is just explode give an example of how that could possibly be true first of all you're not mad about the copyright violation know eliminated in it well as run st john i hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him when he started chief in in in nineteen ninety seven there was an outbreak of bird flu h five and one it was in hong kong and a remarkable doctor in hong kong responded immediately by slaughtering one on point five million chickens and birds and they stop that outbreak in it's tracks immediate detection immediate response than number of years went by in there a lot of rumors about bird flu ron and his team in ottawa begin to crawl the web only crawling twenty thousand different web sites mostly periodicals and they read about and heard about a concern of a lot of children who are high fever and symptoms a bird flu they reported this to w h o w h o took a little while taking action because wh will only receive a report from a government because it's the united nations but they were able to point to wh oh and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that look like bird flu that turned out to be sars that's how the world found out about sars and because of that we were able to stop sars know what's really important is that before there were chief in one hundred percent of all the world's reports of bad things whether you're talking about family you're talking about bird flu you're talking about ebola one hundred percent of all those reports came from nations the moment these guys in ottawa on a budget of eight hundred thousand dollars a year got cracking seventy five percent of all the reports in the world came from jeep and twenty five percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other one hundred and eighty nations now here's what's real interesting after they've been working for a couple years what do you think happened to those nations they felt pretty stupid so they started sending in the reports early and now they're reporting percentages down to fifty percent because other nations have started to report so can you find diseases early by crawling the web course you can can you find him even earlier than jeevan does now of course you can you saw that they found sars using their chinese web crawler of for six weeks before they found it using their english web crawler well they're only crawling and seven languages these bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first and english or spanish or french so yes i want to take jeevan i want to build on it i want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can i want to make is open to everybody so that the health officer in nairobi or and putnam be har will have as much access to it is the folks are not or or and cdc and i want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worse now mers of humanity and that it's accessible to everyone",
