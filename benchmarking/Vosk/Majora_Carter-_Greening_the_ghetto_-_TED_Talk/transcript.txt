[0:00:04 → 0:00:20] if you're here today and i'm very happy that you are you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves however when we're not at ted we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible especially
[0:00:20 → 0:00:27] funnily and aren't large urban areas like new york city and that's because most people with decision making powers in both public and private sector
[0:00:28 → 0:00:30] really don't feel as though they are in danger
[0:00:31 → 0:00:34] the reason why i'm here today in part is because of a dog
[0:00:35 → 0:00:55] and abandoned puppy i found back in the rain back in eighty ninety eight she turned out to be a much bigger dog than i'd anticipated when she came into my life we were fighting against a huge waste facility that plan from the east river waterfront despite the fact that are small part of new york city was already handled more than forty percent of the entire cities commercial waste
[0:00:55 → 0:01:08] a sewage treatment palatine and plant a sewage sludge flat for power plants the world's largest food distribution center as well as other industries that bring more than sixty thousand and diesel treat deal truck trips to the area each week
[0:01:08 → 0:01:28] the area also has where the lowest ratios of parks the people in the city so when i was contacted by the parks department about a ten thousand dollar see grand initiative to help develop waterfront projects i thought they were really well meaning but a bit naive i'd lived in this area all my life and you could not get to the river because of ah the lovely facilities that i'd mentioned earlier
[0:01:29 → 0:01:34] then while jogging with my dog when morning she pulled me into what i thought was just another illegal dump
[0:01:35 → 0:01:55] never were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff and i won't mention here but she kept dragging me and lo and behold at the end of that lot was the river i knew that this forgotten little street and abandoned like the dog they brought me there was worth saving and i knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of a community lead revitalization of the new south bronx and just like my new dog
[0:01:55 → 0:02:15] ugh it was an idea they got bigger than i'd imagined regarded much support along the way and one hunts point riverside park became the first waterfront park them the south bronx it had and more than sixty years we leverage that ten thousand dollars seed grant more than three hundred times in two or three three million dollar park and and the fall i'm actually going to exchange marriage vows with them
[0:02:15 → 0:02:16] my beloved
[0:02:17 → 0:02:17] very much
[0:02:23 → 0:02:26] that's impressive my buttons back there which he does all the time
[0:02:32 → 0:02:39] but those of us living and environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine we feel the problems right now and have for some time
[0:02:40 → 0:03:00] environmental justice for those of you who may not be familiar with the term goes something like this know community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other unfortunately race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff like parks and trees and where one might find the bad stuff like power
[0:03:00 → 0:03:14] our plans and ways facilities as a black person in america i'm twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk of my health i am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility which i do
[0:03:15 → 0:03:35] these land use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity diabetes and asthma why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood our twenty seven percent obesity rate is high even for this country and diabetes comes with it one out of for south bronx children has asthma with our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national
[0:03:35 → 0:03:55] average these impacts are coming everyone's way and we all pay dearly for solid waste cause health problems associated with pollution and more odiously the costs of imprisoning our young black and latino men who possess untold amounts of untapped potential fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line twenty five percent of us are unemployed low income citizens often
[0:03:55 → 0:04:15] use emergency room visits as primary care this comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces know proportional benefits poor people and not only to still poor they are still healthy or unhealthy and fortunately there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low income communities of color in the short term and won't destroy us all in the long term
[0:04:16 → 0:04:21] none of us want that we all have that uncommon so what else do we have in common of course of our own incredibly good looking
[0:04:24 → 0:04:32] graduated high school college postgraduate degrees travel to interesting place it didn't have kids in your early teens financially stable to never been imprisoned
[0:04:34 → 0:04:35] okay good
[0:04:36 → 0:04:48] but besides being a black woman i am different from most of you in some other ways i watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burned down my big brother when he fought in vietnam only to be gun down a few blocks from a hoax
[0:04:53 → 0:04:56] she's of i grew up with a crack house across the street
[0:04:58 → 0:05:00] yeah i'm a poor black child from the ghetto
[0:05:02 → 0:05:03] these things make me different from you
[0:05:04 → 0:05:13] but the things we have in common set me apart for most people in my community and i'm in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice and the other
[0:05:14 → 0:05:34] so how did things get so different for us and the late forties my dad a poem in of sign of a slave bought a house and the hunts point section of the south bronx and few years later he married my mom at the same at the time the community was a mostly white working class neighborhood my dad was not alone and it's others like tim pursued their own version of the american dream white flight the
[0:05:34 → 0:05:37] came common in the south bronx it in many cities around the country
[0:05:38 → 0:05:53] red lining was used by banks were in certain sections of the city including ours were deemed off limits to any sort of investment many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions
[0:05:54 → 0:06:14] dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding hunts point was formerly a walk to work community but now residents had and i neither work nor home to walk to a national highway construction boom was added to our problems in new york state robert moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign one of it's primary goals was to make it easier for residents
[0:06:14 → 0:06:34] of wealthy communities am in westchester county to to go to manhattan the south bronx which lies and between did not stand a chance residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were raised six hundred thousand people were displaced the common perception was it only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the south bronx and if you are told
[0:06:34 → 0:06:49] from your earliest days that nothing good as going to come from your community that is bad and ugly how could it not reflect on you so now my family's property was worthless say for the day it was our home and all we had and luckily for me
[0:06:50 → 0:07:09] that home and the love inside of it along with help from teachers mentors and friends along the way most enough know why is a story important because from are planning prospective economic degradation but gets environmental degradation which big get social degradation the disinvestment that began in the nineteen sixty set the stage
[0:07:09 → 0:07:19] age for all the environmental injustices that word to calm antiquated zoning and land use regulators are still use to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood
[0:07:19 → 0:07:39] are these factors taken into consideration when land use policy has decided what costs are associated with these decisions and who pays who profits does anything justify the look what the local community goes through this was planning and corpse that did not have our best interests in mind once we realize that we decided it was time to do our own planning
[0:07:39 → 0:08:00] that's small park i told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the south bronx i wrote a one and quarter million dollar federal transportation crafted to design the plan for waterfront esplanade with dedicated on street bypass and physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety the placement of to waste another facilities which if done properly don't compromise or communities
[0:08:00 → 0:08:12] cop proc quality of life they provide opportunities for to be more physically active as well as local economic development think bike shops do stance we secure twenty million dollars to build first phase projects this is lafayette avenue
[0:08:13 → 0:08:33] and that's redesigned by matthews nielsen landscape architects and once this path is constructed it'll connect the south bronx with more than four hundred acres of randalls island park right now we're separated by about twenty five feet of water but this link will change that and as we nurture the natural environment it's abundance will give us back even more we run a project call add bronx and my ecological stew
[0:08:33 → 0:08:53] or ship training which provides a job training in the fields of ecological restoration so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well paying jobs little by little were seeding the area with green collar jobs that's both the people that have both financial and personal stake in their environment they started expressway is an utilized relic of the robert moses era girls with
[0:08:53 → 0:09:03] no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it eaten during rush hour it goes virtually unused the community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway
[0:09:04 → 0:09:24] we have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to reenvisioned how does twenty eight acres can be better utilized for parkland affordable housing and local economic development we also built the city's new york city's first green and cool were of demonstration project on top of our offices cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat and pass it onto the building
[0:09:24 → 0:09:44] newer atmosphere green roofs are soil and living plants are both can be used instead of petroleum based roofing materials that absorb heat contribute to urban heat island effect and degrade under the sun which we in turn breathe and greener is also retain up to seventy five percent of rainfall so they reduce the city's need to find costly and of pipes solutions which incidentally are often located in environmental
[0:09:44 → 0:09:49] just as communities like my and they provide habitat for a little friends so
[0:09:51 → 0:09:52] so cool
[0:09:53 → 0:10:01] anyway the demonstration project as a springboard for our own greener if installation business bringing jobs a sustainable economic activity to the south harsh
[0:10:06 → 0:10:07] i like that too
[0:10:09 → 0:10:18] anyway i know chris told us not to do pitches up here but since i have all of your attention we need investors and of pitch it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission anymore
[0:10:27 → 0:10:27] katrina

[0:11:29 → 0:11:33] operations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral
[0:11:34 → 0:11:42] disrupt this presentation today only represent some of what i've been through like a tiny little bit you have no clue or but i'll tell you later if you want to know
[0:11:43 → 0:11:43] vita
[0:11:44 → 0:12:04] i know it's the bottom line or one's perception of it that motivates people in the and i'm interested in what i like to call the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produce developments to have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned the developers government and the community where these projects go up
[0:12:04 → 0:12:07] at present that's not happening in new york city
[0:12:07 → 0:12:27] and we are operating within control comprehensive urban planning deficit a parade of government subsidies is going to propose big box and stadium developments in the south bronx but there is scant coordination between city agencies agencies on how to deal with a cumulative effects of increased traffic pollution solid waste and the impacts on open space and their approach
[0:12:27 → 0:12:47] as to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny but and on because on top of that the richest the world's richest sports team is replacing the house that ruth built by destroying to well love community parks now we'll have even less than that stat i told you about earlier and although less than twenty five percent of south bronx residents own
[0:12:47 → 0:13:08] cars these projects include thousands of new of new parking spaces yet zip in terms of mass public transit now what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fixing at how unhealthy environmentally challenged community vs incorporating structural so sustainable changes my agency is working close
[0:13:08 → 0:13:21] lee with columbia university and others to shine a light on these issues now let's get this straight i am not any development ours is a city not a wilderness preserve and having and and i've embraced my inner capitalist and but i don't have
[0:13:23 → 0:13:25] we probably all haven't we haven't you need to
[0:13:29 → 0:13:39] so i don't have a problem with developers making money there's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable community friendly development can still make a fortune
[0:13:40 → 0:14:00] former nfl tetsuo as bill madonna and amory lovins both heroes of line by the way you don't have shown that you can actually do that i do have a problem with developments that hyper exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit that it continues is a shame upon us all because we are all responsible for the future that we create the one of the things i do to remind myself of
[0:14:00 → 0:14:13] greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries and other cities this is my version of globalization let's take bogota poor latino surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking a reputation not unlike that of the south bronx
[0:14:14 → 0:14:34] however this city was blessed in the late night in the late nineteen nineties with a highly influential man named enrique been yeah llosa and he looked at the demographics few bogota news own cars get a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving that if you're mare you can do something about that his administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares
[0:14:34 → 0:14:50] from five lanes to three outlawed parking on those streets expanded pedestrian walkways and and bike lanes created public plaza as created one of the most efficient bus mass transit systems in the entire world for his brilliant efforts he was nearly impeached
[0:14:51 → 0:15:11] but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day to day lives incredible things happened people stopped the littering crime rates dropped because the streets were alive with people his administration's attacked several typical urban problems at one time and on a third world budget at that we have no excuse
[0:15:11 → 0:15:31] in this country i'm sorry but the bottom line is there are people first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could who could actually afford cars but rather to provide opportunities for all bogota news to participate in the city's resurgence that development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical i
[0:15:31 → 0:15:49] dia here in the us but bogota example has the power to change that you however are blessed with the gift of influence that's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere don't just talk about it at ted
[0:15:50 → 0:16:10] this is a nash it's it's a nationwide policy agenda i'm trying to build and as you all know politics are personal help me make green the new black help me make sustainability sexy make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations helped me five for environmental and economic justice support investments with a triple bottom
[0:16:10 → 0:16:24] line return helped me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and insisting that comprehensive plan planning can be addressed everywhere good got i'm a little more to listen when i spoke to mr gore the other day after breakfast
[0:16:25 → 0:16:34] i asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in this new marketing strategy his response was a grant program
[0:16:36 → 0:16:39] i don't think he understood that i wasn't asking for funding
[0:16:42 → 0:16:44] i was making him an offer
[0:16:49 → 0:16:57] how did he was that this top down approach is still around
[0:16:58 → 0:17:00] they don't get me wrong we need money
[0:17:02 → 0:17:21] but grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision making process of the ninety percent of the energy that mr gore reminded us that we waste everyday don't add wasting our energy intelligence and hard earned experience to that cow
[0:17:21 → 0:17:21] wow
[0:17:22 → 0:17:28] hi have come
[0:17:28 → 0:17:30] from so far
[0:17:32 → 0:17:33] to meet you like this
[0:17:35 → 0:17:37] please don't waste me
[0:17:39 → 0:17:49] by working together we can become one of those small rapidly growing groups of of individuals who actually have the audacity encouraged to believe that we actually can change the world
[0:17:50 → 0:17:56] we might have come to this conference i'm very very different stages in life but believe me
[0:17:57 → 0:17:59] we all share one incredibly powerful thing
[0:18:02 → 0:18:05] we have nothing to lose and everything to gain
[0:18:07 → 0:18:08] job loss
[0:18:08 → 0:18:15] huh

municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three outlawed parking on those streets expanded pedestrian walkways and and bike lanes created public plaza as created one of the most efficient bus mass transit systems in the entire world for his brilliant efforts he was nearly impeached but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day to day lives incredible things happened people stopped the littering crime rates dropped because the streets were alive with people his administration's attacked several typical urban problems at one time and on a third world budget at that we have no excuse in this country i'm sorry but the bottom line is there are people first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could who could actually afford cars but
