[0:00:05 → 0:00:09] it was really making this a well remarkable isn't just the fact that we're finding a little boy
[0:00:10 → 0:00:11] it's how we are finding it
[0:00:17 → 0:00:32] we are drilling all through a long rest of our sections using advanced you're staring to map the subsurface us we go along with unprecedented accuracy to pinpoint the accumulation with high confidence that isn't just a regular well this is a huge leap forward
[0:00:32 → 0:00:33] and how we explore
[0:00:37 → 0:00:53] but current to drilling and the fourth lateral on that woman golfer well in the it'll sit around for a targeting several structures the omega the alpha alpha south sigma northeast and p right now we're staring the whilst towards the sigma east and the p structures
[0:00:53 → 0:00:57] if things are looking really good and were drilling and about ten meters of oil
[0:00:58 → 0:01:01] good indication that we are exactly where we should be
[0:01:10 → 0:01:12] rare occurrence a geo steering the well
[0:01:13 → 0:01:33] which means to us we are placing the well optimal a interests russell are normal we i do not to optimise the production model but and discuss the on drilling and expiration well we're optimizing the while to optimize the data acquisition were collecting massive amount of data with as one proper and more than us ever been
[0:01:33 → 0:01:35] collective before and an expression well
[0:01:36 → 0:01:56] this data will significantly reduce their subsurface uncertainty that omega an old or a continuation of the work they started two years ago with us take their way of i'm from exploration twenty two development in just two years geological this is very similar to us think you're seeing a tin all call them
[0:01:56 → 0:01:58] trapped beneath and in progress or shame
[0:01:59 → 0:02:02] in this saturday and efficiency and for hundred albums
[0:02:04 → 0:02:12] two years ago with the is fraying well we set a new benchmark an expiration achieving more than thirty kilometers arrest or squashing
[0:02:13 → 0:02:19] a year later on frank i'm a geo pilot we further push the limits and drill length and r o p versus all cleaning
[0:02:21 → 0:02:37] since then with often than best performing ring in the market and back on contract we have done several performance improving upgrades and equip the ring with wire pipe this puts us at a position to not only push the limits that making a step change in performance
[0:02:38 → 0:02:47] we started off during the longest well every role in norway with the standup expiration one this sign and whether the following the low flow and hi are a piece strategy
[0:02:48 → 0:03:01] we have the event several own drilling practices improve that technical limit is still to be this is only the beginning and i look forward to continue pushing the limits for what's technically feasible underlying a while
[0:03:05 → 0:03:11] how can be isn't perfect match for just just don't want they have ambition goals and push limits
[0:03:12 → 0:03:17] every single day our team deliver safely securely i'm a girl just level
[0:03:18 → 0:03:24] with the upgrades made for aka be pro contract teachers too long has become on iraq shopper drilling machine
[0:03:25 → 0:03:34] we look forward from many great year sad we do milestones new records i'm i could change it focused and safety quality and collaboration
[0:03:42 → 0:03:45] being part of this operation has been a true pleasure
[0:03:46 → 0:03:49] simply just showing performers first put into action
[0:03:50 → 0:04:02] thanks to old chill and halliburton and the good collaboration offshore we are able to do this and not to mention degrades planning and support from our onshore team
[0:04:03 → 0:04:05] with their high called the engineering
[0:04:06 → 0:04:15] constantly pushing boundaries and the willingness to take risk we are able to deliver world class results as warm tea
