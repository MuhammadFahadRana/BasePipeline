  "text": "hello voicemail my old friend i've called for tech support again i nor my boss this morning my money on a monday morning now it's evening and my dinner first or a cold and and groom old i'm still on hold i'm listening to this of silence i don't think you understand i think your phone lines are on man i punched every touchstone i was told but nice to spend eighteen hours on goal it's not enough their software crashed my mac and it constantly hangs in bomb he raised my rom is now the mac makes this use of silence my dreams that averaging vengeance on you guys say your motorcycle drag blood comes gushing from your gash with you're fading straight you call nine one one can you pray for a train and the but you get me did you listen do this this guy good evening and welcome to spot the ted presenter who used to be a broadway accompanist okay when i was offered the times column six years ago it was the deal was like this you will be sent to coolest hottest slickest new gadgets every week it'll arrive at your door you get to try him out play with them evaluate them for and so the novelty wears back for reactors and back and you'll get paid for it you can think about it if you aren't so i've always been in technology and nuts absolutely love it the job though came with one small downside and that as they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column and what i've noticed his first of all you get an incredible amount of email if you ever are feeling lonely get a new york times column because you will get hundreds and hundreds of emails in the email and getting a lot today is about frustration people are feeling like things okay i just an alarm come up on my screen lucky you can see it people are feeling overwhelmed they're feeling like it's too much technology too fast it may maybe good technology but i feel like there's not enough of the support structure there's not enough help there's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach del technical support and within twelve hours there were seven hundred messages from readers on the feedback words on the times website from users say me to and here's my tale of woe i call a software rage and man let me tell you who ever figures out how to make money off of this this frustration will oh of accurate of the to school okay so why is the problem accelerating and part of the problem is ironically it's because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use our i'll show you what i mean this is what the computer interface used to look like dos over the years it's gotten easier to use this is the original mac operating system reagan was president madonna we still brunette and the entire operating system this is a good part the entire operating system fit in two hundred and eleven a you couldn't put the mac o s ten logo in two hundred and eleven k so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical broader audience were coming into contact with this equipment for the first time i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to and the calls that you know how they say your call me be recorded for quality assurance your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb users stories and passed around on a cd which they do and and i have a copy so in your gifts back known or unknown and i was there were voices on it so some of these stories are just so classical a classic and yet so understandable woman called apple to complain that her mouse who squeaking making a squeaking noise in the technicians said well ma'am what you mean your mouse is squeaky she's i can tell you is that it squeaks louder the faster i move it across the screen can the tech isn't like man your you've got the mouse up against the screen shows what the message said click here to continue well if you're like that one how much jammer yeah in other one know a guy called this is absolutely true and his computer had crashed and he told the technician you couldn't restarted it no matter how many times he typed eleven in the textures that was why are you typing eleven is a the message says error type eleven so so we must admit this some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users but why is the technical overload prices the complexity of crisis accelerating now in the hardware world is because we the consumers want everything to be smaller smaller smaller so the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier but our fingers are essentially staying the same size so it gets more and more of a challenge software is subject to another primal force the me mandate to release more and more versions when you buy a piece of software it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar where you own it it's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year and every year they say we've added more features and will sell it to for ninety nine dollars i know one guy who spent four thousand dollars just on photo shop over the years and software companies make thirty five percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades i call it the software upgrade paradox which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it i mean microsoft word was last just a word processor and you know the eisenhower administration so but what's the alternative microsoft actually did this experiment they said we'd him and everyone complains that we're adding so many features let's create a word processors that's just a word processor simple pure does not do web pages is not a database and it came oh it was called microsoft right and none of your nodding in acknowledgment because it died it take no one ever bought it i call this the sport utility principal people liked to surround themselves with unnecessary power right they don't need the database in the website but they're like will operate because because i might i'm i need that some day so the problem is as you add more features where are they going to go where you going to stick them you only have so many design tools you can do buttons you can do sliders pop up menus sub menus but if you're not careful about how you choose you wind up with this this is an only touch this is not a joke henri touch quota of microsoft word because we did you have with all the toolbar is open you you've obviously never opened all the schools partners but all you have to type in his is cheating windows and we've arrived at the age of of interface maitre sees where there's so many features and options you have to do two dimensions you know a vertical and horizontal you guys all complain about how microsoft word is always bullet in your lists and underlining your links to automatically the off switch is in there somewhere i'm telling you it's their part of the art of designing a simple good interface is knowing when to use which one of these features so here is the log off but dialog box for windows two thousand and there are only four choices so why are they in a pop up menu it's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices they couldn't put them all out and view hears apple's take on the exact same dialog box this is figure yeah i designed to dial about now already we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design microsoft approach to simplicity tends to be let's break it down let's just make it more steps they are there are these wizards everywhere and you know there's a new version of windows coming out this fall if they continue with this pace there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up welcome to the type of word wizard okay i'll bite let's click next to continue the dropdown menu choose the first letter you wanted it so there is a limit that we don't want to growth so what is the answer how do you pack in all these features in a simple intelligent way i believe that consistency when possible real world equivalents trashcan folder when possible label things mostly but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest role of all which is intelligence know what do i mean by that i'm going to give you some examples where intelligence make something not consistent but it's better if you are buying something on the web you are supposed to put it in your address and you're supposed to choose what country you're from okay there are two hundred countries in the world we like to think of the intern global village i'm sorry it's not one yet it's mainly like the united states europe and japan so why is united states in the use you have to scroll like seven screens for the get to it now it would be inconsistent to put united states first but it would be intelligent this one's been touched on before but why in god's name you shut down and windows pc by clicking a button called start here's another pet owner of mine you have a printer most of the time you want to print one copy of your document in page order on that printer so why in god's name do you see this every time you read it's like a seven forty seven show it and one of the buttons or the bought a new notice is not print now i'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the the colts of simplicity of palm is also especially all days wonderful about this i actually got to speak to palm and they were flying high in the nineties and after the talk i met when the employees uses nice talking to thank you would you do here is that i'm at tap counter you're what news or jeff hawkins the e o says if any task on the palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus it's too long and it has to be redesign so i'm a tab powder so i'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter this is microsoft word okay when you want to create a new blank document in word it could happen the you go up to the file menu and you choose new now what happens when you choose new do you get a new blank document you do not on the opposite side of the monitor a taskbar appears in somewhere in those links by the way not at the top somewhere in those legs is a button it's makes you a new documents okay so that is accompanied not counting tap you know i don't want i want to just stand here make fun of microsoft yes i do good bill gates song i vidic need forever and i wrote the very first dos i moved my software and i b m together a profit and they got the loss i write the code that makes the whole world around i'm in royalties from everyone sometimes it's garbage but the press news snowed you by the box and also become every software company doing microsoft mar and d you can't keep a good idea down these days even windows is a hacker we kind of based loosely on the mac so it's big so if you got nowhere to go i'm not doing more praying i write the code that it's the world today being mediocrity in everywhere we've answered planet and a nation you'll have no choice so by my code i am bill gates and i write the code but actually i believe are really to microsoft there's the old one responsible for windows and office they would do they're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can't they're locked in because so many add ons and other companies stuff locks in the old nineteen eighty two chassis so but there's also a new microsoft it's really do doing good simple interface designs i like the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch the watch a wireless watch flopped miserably in the market but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed let's put it this way would you pay ten dollars a month to have a watch that has to do you charge every night like your cell phone and stops work thing when you leave your area code so the signs my indicate that the complexity crunches only going to get worse so is there any hope of the screens are getting smaller people or eliminating putting manuals in the boxes their can things are coming out at a faster pace it's funny when steve jobs came back to apple ninety ninety seven after twelve years away it was a macro of expo became to the stage net black turtleneck and jeans and you sort of did this the crowd went wild but i had just seen and that we've seen this before i had just seen the movie of veto with madonna and i'm like you i gotta do what about steve jobs i just it won't be easy you think i'm stream when i try to explain why i'm back after telling the press apple's future is black he won't be late me all the juicy the get in his teens you started out in a garage with only a buddy named why you try rhyming with garage don't cry for me cupertino the to be is i never left you know the ropes now know what the tricks are i made a fortune over at pixar driver two words are you know still god i've envisioned i still wear sandals and any whether it's just that these days they're gucci lever so few jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty and the the truth is for years i was a little depressed because americans obviously did not value it because the mac had three percent market share windows and ninety five percent market share people did not think it was worth putting a price on it so i was i was little depressed and and i heard out course talking to realize i didn't know the meaning of depressed credit but but it turns out i was wrong right because the ipod came out in it violated every bit of common wisdom other products cost less other products had more features they had voice recorders and fm transmitters other the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard not apple's proprietary standard but the i pod wouldn't this is the one they were wanted the lesson was simplicity cells in there are signs that the industry is getting the message this is a little company that's a very well with simplicity and elegance the sooners thing it's catching on get just a couple examples it physically a really cool elegant thinking coming along lately when you have a digital camera how do you get the pictures back to your camera computer well you you there are all around the u s be cable or you buy a card reader and whole that around either when you're going to lose what i do is i take out the memory card and i folded in half revealing us be contacts i just stick it in the computer awkward the pictures put it right back in the camera and never have to lose anything here's another example chris year the source of all power will you be my power plug hole that and don't let go you might have seen this this is apple's new laptop this is the power cord it hooks on like this and i'm sure everyone have you done this is some point your lives or one of your children you walk along and i'm like i'm mark to pull the one of the floor i don't care it's a loner hearing oh wow it's magnetic it doesn't pull the laptop on it before in my very last example i i do lot of my work using speech recognition software and i'll just you have to be kind of quiet because the software's nervous okay speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly period like i get hundreds of them a day period and it's not just what i dictate that it writes down period i also use this feature called voice macros period correct dissuade not just okay this is not an ideal situation because it's getting the echo from the palms up but the point is i i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word and having right out a much longer think so if somebody sends me a fan letter all say thanks for that and conversely if somebody sends me hate mail which happens daily i say piss off so get my dirty little secret don't tell anyone so the point is this is a really interesting story this is version eight of the software and you know what they put in version eight no new features it's never happened before and software become be put no new features they just said will make this software work right right because for years people have bought the software tried it out ninety five percent accuracy was all day this means one in twenty words is wrong and they put it in their drawer and the company got sick of that so he said this version we're not going to do anything but make sure it's darn accurate and so that's what they did this this cult of doing things right is starting to spread so my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology remember if it doesn't work is not nasa sara lee you okay could be the design of the thing you're using be were in life of good design and bad design and if you are among the people who create this stuff easy is hard priests sweat the details for your audience count the taps remember the hard part is not deciding what features the ad is deciding what to leave out and best of all your motivation is simplicity cells and my hair",
