[0:00:04 → 0:00:20] on september tenth the morning of my seventh birthday i came downstairs of the kitchen where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something and i sort of presenting myself to them in the doorway and they said hey happy birthday and i said
[0:00:20 → 0:00:40] i'm seven and my father smiled and said well you know what that means don't you and i said yeah that i have a party and a cake can get a lot of presence and my dad said well yes but more importantly being seven means that you reach the age of reason and your now capable of committing any and all sins of
[0:00:40 → 0:00:41] james god and man
[0:00:44 → 0:00:58] now i had heard this phrase age of reason before sister mary kevin had been banding and about my second grade class at school but when she said it the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for first communion and our first confession
[0:00:58 → 0:01:09] but he knew that was really all about the white dress in the white veil and anyway i haven't really paid all that much attention to that phrase age of reason so i said yeah yeah age of reason
[0:01:11 → 0:01:28] and my dad said well we believe in the catholic church that god knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong but when you're seven year old enough to know better so you've grown up and reached the age of reason and now god will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record
[0:01:29 → 0:01:32] and i said oh
[0:01:34 → 0:01:44] wait a minute you mean all that time up till today all that time i was so good god didn't notice it and my mom said well i noticed
[0:01:47 → 0:02:01] i thought how can i not have known this before how could it not have some game when they've been telling me all that being good and no real credit for it and worst of all how can i not have realize this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me
[0:02:01 → 0:02:20] so is it won't mom and dad what about santa claus i mean santa claus knows of your naughty or nice ride and my dad said he would honey i think that's technically just between thanksgiving and christmas and my mother said oh perhaps stop it let's just stoller i mean she's seven julie there is no santa claus
[0:02:23 → 0:02:24] now
[0:02:24 → 0:02:45] this was actually not that upsetting to me my parents had this holy labyrinth story about santa claus how they had talked to santa claus himself and agree that instead of santa delivering our presence over the night of christmas eve like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing christmas morning our family would give santa more time santa we're going to our house while we were
[0:02:45 → 0:02:50] nine o'clock high mass on christmas morning but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss
[0:02:50 → 0:02:52] which made me very suspicious
[0:02:53 → 0:03:03] it was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us to present presence i mean my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style and my mother's handwriting was so close to santas
[0:03:04 → 0:03:23] this one that sent to save time by having the loop back to our house have really gone to everybody is there is only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit and my poor parents are trying to protect us from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection by sam to
[0:03:24 → 0:03:40] who was jolie but let's face it he was also very judgmental so to find out that there was no santa claus at all was actually sort of a relief i went the kitchen not really in shock about santa but rather i was just dumbfounded about how it could to miss this whole age of reason thing
[0:03:41 → 0:03:42] it was too late for me
[0:03:43 → 0:04:03] maybe i could help someone else someone who could use the information they had to fit to criteria they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason and not yet seven the answer was clear my brother bill he was six well i finally found bill about a block away from our house of this public school playground it was a sater
[0:04:03 → 0:04:07] dany was all by himself just kicking a ball against a side of a wall i run up to into bill
[0:04:08 → 0:04:28] i just realized that the age of reason and you turned seven and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against god and man and bill said so and i said so your six you have a whole you to do anything you want to thank god will notice that and he said so and i it so so everything
[0:04:28 → 0:04:38] and i turned around and i was so angry with him but when i go to the top of the steps i turned around dramatically and said oh by the way bill there is no santa claus
[0:04:40 → 0:04:55] now i didn't know what at the time but i really wasn't turning seven on september tenth for my thirteenth birthday i planned to slumber party with all of my girlfriends but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said i need to speak to you privately
[0:04:56 → 0:05:02] september tenth is not your birthday it's october tenth and i said what
[0:05:03 → 0:05:03] and she said
[0:05:06 → 0:05:06] listen
[0:05:08 → 0:05:11] the cut off date to start kindergarten with september fifteen
[0:05:12 → 0:05:22] so i told him that your birthday was of tambor tampa and then i wasn't sure that you want just gonna go boy habit all over the place so i started to tell you your birthday was september tenth
[0:05:23 → 0:05:26] julia was so ready to start school honey you are so ready
[0:05:27 → 0:05:47] i thought about it when i was for i was already the oldest of four children and my mother even had another child the come so what i think she understandably really meant was that she was already she was ready then she said don't worry julie every year on october tenth when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it i made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day
[0:05:50 → 0:05:56] which was comforting but troubling my mother had been celebrating my birthday with me without me
[0:05:57 → 0:06:16] what was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that i was going out to change the date of my slumber party with all my girlfriends what was most upsetting was that this meant i was not a virgo i had a huge will go poster in my bedroom and i read my scope every single day and it was so totally me
[0:06:18 → 0:06:20] and this meant that i was a libra
[0:06:21 → 0:06:41] so we took the bus downtown to get the new libor poster the virgo posters a picture of a beautiful woman with long here's what of lounging by some water but the lever posters just a huge scale this was around the time that i started filling out physically and i was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls and frankly the whole idea that my astrological sign was a
[0:06:41 → 0:06:44] scale just seemed ominous and dump depressing
[0:06:47 → 0:06:57] but i got the new leave my poster and i started to read my new me bro horoscope and i was astonished to find that it was also totally me
[0:06:58 → 0:07:12] it wasn't until years later looking back on this whole age of reason change of birthday thing that it dawned on me i wasn't earning seven when i thought i turned seven i had a whole other month give do anything i want i do everyone got started keeping tabs on me
[0:07:12 → 0:07:14] oh life can be so cruel
[0:07:15 → 0:07:20] one day to mormon missionaries came to my door
[0:07:20 → 0:07:40] now i just live off a main thoroughfare in los angeles and my block is well to natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door i'm sometimes i get little old ladies from the seventh day adventist church showing these cartoon pictures of heaven and sometimes i get teenagers who promised me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people of i only buy some magazines subscribe
[0:07:40 → 0:08:00] patients from them so normally i just ignore the doorbell but on this day i answered and there's still two boys each about nineteen and white start short sleeved shirts and they have little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and they said they had a message for me from
[0:08:00 → 0:08:06] god i said a message for me from god and they said yes
[0:08:07 → 0:08:26] now i was raised in the pacific northwest around a lot of church of latter day saints people and you know i've worked with them and even dated them but i never really knew the doctor and or what they said to people when they were out on a mission and i guess was sort of curious so i said the please come in and they looked really happy because i don't think this happens to them all that often
[0:08:27 → 0:08:31] and i sat him down and i i got them glasses of water
[0:08:33 → 0:08:33] no
[0:08:41 → 0:08:45] okay i gotta i gotta i gotta go through the water don't touch my hear about the thing
[0:08:49 → 0:08:54] you can put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my here
[0:08:55 → 0:08:55] okay
[0:09:00 → 0:09:07] so i set them down and i got them glasses of water and after niceties they said do you believe that god loves you with all his hard and i thought
[0:09:08 → 0:09:25] well of course i believe in god but you know i don't like that word heart because if anthropomorphizes god in i don't like the word his either because that sexualizes god but i didn't want to argue semantics of these boys so after very long uncomfortable pause i said
[0:09:26 → 0:09:33] yes yes i do i feel very loved and they looked at each other and smiled like that was the right answer
[0:09:34 → 0:09:54] and then they say do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet and i said yes i do yes i do and i was so relieved that was a question i could answer so quickly and they said well then we have a story to tell you and they told me the story all about this guy name lehigh who lived in jerusalem and six hundred bc now apparently in jerusalem and six
[0:09:54 → 0:10:09] bc everyone was completely bad and evil every single one of them man woman child infant fetus and god came to lee high and said to him put your family on a boat and i will lead you out of here and god did lead them he led them to america
[0:10:10 → 0:10:12] i said america
[0:10:14 → 0:10:20] from jerusalem to america by boat and six hundred b c and they said yes
[0:10:22 → 0:10:37] then they told me how lehigh in his descendants reproduced and reproduce and over the course of six hundred years there were two great races of them the neophytes and the layman eyes and then he fights were totally totally good each and every one of them and the lame and i were totally bad and evil every single one of them just bad of the bone
[0:10:38 → 0:10:38] this
[0:10:39 → 0:10:45] after jesus died on the cross for our sins on his way up to heaven he stopped by america and visited the me fights
[0:10:47 → 0:11:06] and he told them that that if they all remain totally totally good each and every one of them they would win the war against the evil lame and nights but apparently somebody blew it because the lame i were able to kill all the neophytes all but one guy this guy in a mormon who managed to survive by hiding in the woods and he made sure this whole story
[0:11:06 → 0:11:15] written down in reform the egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates which he then buried near pallmeyer in new york
[0:11:20 → 0:11:23] well i was just on the edge of my seat
[0:11:26 → 0:11:33] i said what happened to the labour nights and they said well they became our native americans here in the us
[0:11:33 → 0:11:40] and it's it's so you believe the native americans are descended from of people who were totally evil and they said yes
[0:11:41 → 0:11:57] then he told me how this guy named joseph smith found that those barely gold plates right in his back yard any also found the magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed egyptian into english
[0:11:58 → 0:12:02] what this point i just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch
[0:12:06 → 0:12:06] i wanted to say
[0:12:09 → 0:12:11] okay don't start with this story
[0:12:12 → 0:12:17] i mean even the scientologists know to start with a personality task before they start
[0:12:19 → 0:12:23] telling people all about reno the evil intergalactic all of my lord
[0:12:24 → 0:12:44] well then they said do you believe that god speaks to us through his righteous profits and i said no i don't because i was sort of upset about this lehman i'd story in this crazy gold plate story but the truth was i hadn't really thought this through so i backpedal the little and i said whoa what what exactly do you mean by righteous and and what do you mean by profits like could the prop
[0:12:44 → 0:12:54] it's be women and they said no and i said why and they said well it's because god gave women a gift that is so spectacular
[0:12:54 → 0:13:01] it is so wonder that the only give the have left over to give men was the gift of prophecy
[0:13:01 → 0:13:08] what is this wonderful gift god gave women i wondered maybe they're greater ability to cooperate and adapt
[0:13:09 → 0:13:29] women's longer lifespan the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men but no it wasn't any of these gifts they said modes her ability to bear children i said oh come on i mean even even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were fifteen at the time they were forty five assuming they didn't die from exhaustion is still seems like
[0:13:30 → 0:13:35] some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god and they said now
[0:13:38 → 0:13:55] well then they didn't look so fresh faced and cute to me anymore but they had more to say they said well we also believe that if you're a mormon and if you're in good standing with the church when you die you get to go to your go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity and i said oh really
[0:14:02 → 0:14:04] that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me
[0:14:05 → 0:14:05] i said
[0:14:08 → 0:14:26] hey we also believe that when you go to heaven or you get your body restored to you in his best original state like if you lost a leg why you get a backer or if you gone blind you could see i said oh now i don't have a uterus because i had cancer a few years ago so does this mean that if i went to heaven i would get my old
[0:14:26 → 0:14:32] uterus back and they said sure and i said i don't want it back
[0:14:33 → 0:14:34] happy without it
[0:14:35 → 0:14:39] gosh what if you had a nose job and like dick
[0:14:40 → 0:14:54] what god for sure it gets year old knows that will then they gave me this book of mormon and they told me to read this chapter in that chapter and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me and i think i said something like please don't hurry or maybe was just please don't and they were gone
[0:14:55 → 0:15:01] okay so i initially felt really superior to these boys and smog in my more conventional faith
[0:15:02 → 0:15:18] and the more i thought about it the more i had to be honest with myself if someone came to my door and i was hearing catholic theology and dogma for the very first time and they said we believe that god impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacal important does
[0:15:20 → 0:15:27] and she had a baby and that's the son of god i mean i would think that equally ridiculous i'm just so used to about story
[0:15:28 → 0:15:35] so i couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys but the question they asked me when i first arrived really stuck in my head
[0:15:36 → 0:15:38] did i believe that god love me with all his heart
[0:15:39 → 0:15:59] because i wasn't exactly sure how i felt about that question now if they'd ask me do you do feel that god loves you with all his heart will that would have been much different i think i would have instantly answered yes yes i feel it all the time i i feel god's love when i'm hurt and confused am i feel consoled and cared for i take shelter
[0:15:59 → 0:16:06] god's love when i don't understand why tragedy hits and and i feel god's love when i look with gratitude at all the beauty i see
[0:16:07 → 0:16:16] but since they ask me that question with the word believe in that somehow it was all different because i wasn't exactly sure if i believed what i so clearly felt

on september tenth the morning of my seventh birthday i came downstairs of the kitchen where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something and i sort of presenting myself to them in the doorway and they said hey happy birthday and i said i'm seven and my father smiled and said well you know what that means don't you and i said yeah that i have a party and a cake

ask me do you do feel that god loves you with all his heart will that would have been much different i think i would have instantly answered yes yes i feel it all the time i i feel god's love when i'm hurt and confused am i feel consoled and cared for i take shelter god's love when i don't understand why tragedy hits and and i feel god's love when i look with gratitude at all the beauty i see but since they ask me that question with the word believe in that somehow it was all different because i wasn't exactly sure if i believed what i so clearly felt
