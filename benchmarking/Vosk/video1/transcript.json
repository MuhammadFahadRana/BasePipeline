  "text": "i'm going to take you on a journey very quickly to explain the wish i mean to have to take you somewhere which many people haven't been and that's around the world when i was about twenty four years old kate store myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved and humanitarian work and not only about responding to natural disasters that involved in systemic issues we believe that where the resources and expertise a scarce innovative sustainable design design can really make a difference in people's lives so this all began my i started my life as an architect or of training as an architect and i was always interested in socially responsible design and how you can really make an impact but when i went to architecture school it seems that i was a black sheep in the family many architects seem to think that when you design you design a jewel and the it's a jewel that you try and crave for whereas i felt that when you design you either improve or you create a detriment to the community and which were designing and so you not just doing a building for the residents or or or for the people going to use it but for the community as a whole and nineteen ninety nine we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in kosovo and i didn't know what i was doing like i say mid twenties and i'm up on the internet generation so we started a website we put a call out there and to my surprise and a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world that led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas in two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub saharan africa responding to the hiv aids pandemic that that led to five hundred and fifty entries from fifty three countries we also have design from around the world that participate and we had an exhibit of work that that followed that two thousand and four was the tipping point for us we started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in iran and bam also following up on i work in africa working within the united states most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner but go live i live in bozeman montana and go up to the north plans on the reservations or go down to alabama or mississippi pre katrina on i could have shown you places that have far worse condition than many developing countries i've been to so we got involved and and were in inner cities and elsewhere and then also i will go into some more project two thousand and five me mother nature kicked our ass i think we can pretty much assume the two thousand and five was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters and because of the internet and because of connections to blogs and so forth with in literally hours of the tsunami we were already raising funds getting involved working with with people on the ground we run from a couple of laptops and in the first couple of days i had four thousand and emails from people needing help so we began to get involved in projects there and i'll talk about some others and then of course this year we've been responding to katrina as well as following up on a reconstruction work so this is a brief overview in two thousand and four i really couldn't manage the number of people who want to help or the number of requests that i was getting it was all coming into my laptop and cell phone so we decided to embrace and open basically an open source model of business that anyone anywhere in the world could start local chapter and they can get involved in local problems because i believe there is no such thing as utopia or problems a local or solutions a local so and that means you know somebody who's based in in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do so that so so what happened is we used meet up and all these other kind of internet tools and we ended up having forty chapters starting up thousands of architects and one hundred and four countries so the the bullet point sorry never do a suit so i knew the i was can take self okay because i'm going to do very quick so in the past seven years this isn't just about non profit what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and the we have the opportunity not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involved in making change you know i'm adding that to my time wow so what you don't know it's we've got these thousands of design working around the world with connected basically by a website and we have a staff of three by doing something the fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it we did it and so that's something to be said about and they overtake so seven years later we've developed so that we've got advocacy instigation implementation we advocate for good design not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums op eds we have a book on humanitarian work but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy we can talk about fema but that's another talk instigation developing ideas with communities and and years doing open source design competitions referring matchmaking with communities and then implementing actually going out there and doing the work because when you invent it's never a reality until it's built so it's really important that if we're designing and and trying to create change we build that change so here's a select number of projects kosovo this is kosovo and ninety nine we did an open design competition like i said it led to a whole variety of of ideas and this wasn't about emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to ten years that would be placed next to the land resident lived in and that they would rebuild their own home this wasn't in posing and architecture on a community this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow at the way they want to we had from the sublime to the ridiculous but they work to this an inflatable hemp house it was built it works this is a shipping container built and works on a whole variety of ideas to not only dealt with architectural building but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating community through complex networks so we've engaged not just designers but also you know a whole variety of technology based professionals are using and rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes i'm using straw bale construction creating heat walls and then something remarkable happened and ninety nine as we went to africa originally to look at the housing issue within three days we realized the problem was not housing it was that the growing pandemic of hiv aids and it wasn't doctors telling us this it was actually villages that we were staying with and so we came up with bright idea that instead of getting people to walk ten fifteen kilometers to see doctors you get the doctors to the people and we started engaging that the medical community and i thought you know we thought we were real bright you know sparks we've come up with great idea mobo health clinics that can could look widely distributed throughout sub saharan africa and the community the medical community there said we've said this for the last decade we know this we just don't know how to show this so in a way we take a pre existing needs and shown solutions and so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in this one i personally love because the idea that architecture is not just about solutions but about raising awareness this is a canal clinic you get seed and you grow up in a plot of land and then once and it grows fourteen feet in a month and on the fourth week the doctors come and they mow an area for ten cell structure on the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villages you cut down the clinic and you eat it it's and eat your own clinic so it's dealing with the fact that if you have have age you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea that the the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti retrovirus out there so you know this a serious serious solution this one i love the idea is it's not just the clinic it's a community center this so this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self sustaining project every one of these projects is sustainable that's not because i'm a tree hugging green person it's because when you live on four dollars a day you living on survival and you have to be sustainable you have to know where your energies coming from you have to know where your resources coming from and you have to keep the maintenance down so this is this is about getting an economic engine and then at night it turns into a movie theater so it's not a clinic it's it's a community center so you can see ideas and these ideas that developed into prototypes and they are eventually bill a currently as of this year there are clinics rolling out in nigeria and kenya from that we also developed see a tambor which was a project the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don't have education and we're working in an area where young women between the ages of sixteen and twenty four have a fifty percent hiv aids rate and that's not because they're promiscuous it's because there's no knowledge and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an hiv aids outreach center and the coaches of the girls team or also trained doctors so the that would be a very slow way of developing kind of confidence in health care and we pick nine finalist and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region and then the community pick their design they said this is our design because it's not only about engaging a community it's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding pros this so the winning design is here and then of course we actually go and work with the community and the clients so this is the designer he's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in kwazulu natal see a tamba and they can tell it better as it says a whole so well my name is stacey because i work at the cassette of let's use of consultant a liberal saw the national football player force of africa idea that i live in the also play in the am what i couldn't leave for the team called be said to us which has now changed to september this is our home so i'm going to show that latex i'm running out of time i can see chris looking at me slyly this was a connection just just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop the for africa's first telemedicine center in tanzania and we met literally a couple of months ago we've already developed to design the team is over there working in partnership this was a matchmaking thanks to a couple of tedsters son cheryl how in and rizzoli who connected me with this amazing african woman and we start construction in june and it will be open by ted global so when you come to take global you can check it out but what we know probably most for is dealing with disasters and development and we've been involved in a lot of issues such as the tsunami also things like hurricane katrina this is a three hundred and seventy dollar shelter that can be easily assembled i'm go this is a community design community designed community center and what that means as we actually live and work with the community and that part of the design process the kids actually get involved in mapping out where the the the community center should be and then eventually the community is actually with through skills training end up building the building with us the here is another school this is what the unit un gave these guys for six months this twelve plastic tarps this was an august this was the replacement supposed to last for two years when the rain comes down you can't hear a thing and in the summer it's about one hundred and forty degrees inside so we said if the reins coming down let's get fresh water so so every one of our schools have rainwater collection systems very low cost a class three classrooms and rainwater collection is five thousand dollars this was raised by hot chocolate sales in our in atlanta the it's built by the parents of the kids the kids are out there on site building the buildings and it opened a couple of weeks ago and this six hundred kids that now using the schools so disaster hits home we've seen we we see the bad stories on cnn and fox and all that but we don't see the good stories here is a community that got together and they said no to way to to waiting they formed a partnership diverse partnership of players to actually map out east biloxi to figure out who's getting involved we've had over fifteen hundred volunteer here's rebuilding rehabbing homes we're figuring out what fema regulations are not waiting for them to dictate to us what how you should rebuild working with residents getting out them out of their home so they don't get ill this is what they're cleaning up on their own designing housing this house is going to go in couple of weeks this is a rehab home done and four days this is a utility room for a woman who's on a on a walker she's seventy years old this is what female gave her six hundred bucks happened two days ago we put together very quickly or washroom it's built it's running and she just started a business today where she's watching other people's clothes this is sandra the calhoun that photographers who had documented the lower ninth for the last forty years that was their home and these are the photographs they took and were helping working with them to create a new building projects we've done projects we've been in a part of support why don't aid agencies do this this is the you and ten this is a new you and ten just introduce this year quick to assemble it's got a flap that's the invention it took twenty years to design this and get it implemented in the field i was twelve years old there's a problem here luckily we're not alone there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work more hemp houses it's a theme in japan apparently i'm not sure that smoking this is a great clip designed by somebody who said all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams this guy designed for for nasa is now doing housing i'm going to whip through this quickly that know i got only a couple of minutes so this is all done in the last two years i showed you something that took twenty years to do and this is just a selection of things that got happened and that that were built in the last couple of years from brazil to india mexico alabama china israel palestine vietnam the average age of a designer who gets involved in this project has thirty two the told i am so it's a young i just have to stop here because our is in the room and this is the best design toilet in the world if you're ever ever in india go use the toilet chris lou become will tell you why i'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party but but the future is not going to be the skyscraping cities of new york but this and when you look at this use the crisis what i see as many many inventors one billion people live in abject poverty we hear about them all the time for billion live in and growing but fragile economies one in seven live in unplanned settlements if we do nothing about the housing crisis it's about to happen in twenty years one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or refugee camp looked left look right one of you will be there how do we improve the the living standards of five billion people with ten million solutions so i wish to develop a community that actively embrace if innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone what is that what does that cover that's your wish that's my were shut his wife we started arctic for humanity with seven hundred dollars in a website so chris somehow decided to give me one hundred thousand so why not this many people open source architecture is the way to go you have a diverse community of a participant and we're not just talking about inventors and designers but we talking about the funding model at my role is not as a designer it's it's a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world and what we need is something that replicates me the globally because i haven't slept in seven years secondly what will this thing be designers want to respond to issues of of humanitarian crisis but they don't want some company in the west taking their idea and basically profiting from it so creative commons it developed the developing nations license and what that means the a designer can we the see a timber project i showed was the first ever building to have a creative commons license on it as soon as that is built anyone in africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free fuck why not why not allow design as the opportunity to do this but still protecting their rights here we want to have a community where you can upload ideas and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake in flood in all sorts of a steer environments the reason that's important is i don't want to wait for the next katrina to find out if my house works that's too late we need to do it now so doing that globally and the i want this whole thing to work multilingual lee when you look at the face of an architect most people think a grey haired white guy i don't see that i see the face of the world so i want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this devote design and development the of needs based competitions x prize for the other ninety eight percent if you want to call it that we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together and the idea of integrating manufacturers fab labs in every country when i hear about one hundred dollar laptop and it's going to educate every child educate every designer in the world put one in every for valla every slum settlement because you know what innovation will happen and i need to know that it's called the leap back we talk about leap frog technologies are right with world changing and the one thing we've been talking about as i learn more on the ground than i've ever learnt here so let's take those ideas adapt them and we can use them these ideas are supposed to have adaptable they're allowed to be they they should have the pet potential for evolution they should be developed by every nation on the world and useful for every nation on the world what will it take there should be a sheet i don't have time to read this because i'm going to be yanked off because just leave it up for that okay what what will it take yeah you guys are smart so it's going to take a lot of computing power because i want this i want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs but utilize the designs also a process of reviewing the designs i want every hour engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that standing because those guys all the best in the world plug and so you know i want these and and i just should know i have two laptops and one of them the is there and that has three thousand designs on it if i drop that laptop what happens so it's important to have these proven ideas put up that easy to use easy to get a hold of my mom once said there's nothing worse than being all mouth and know trousers i'm fed up of talking about making change you only make it by doing it we've changed fema guidelines we've changed public policy we've changed international response based on building things so for me it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation and then it's free innovate i can think of free culture this is free innovation somebody said this couple of years back i will give points for those who know it but i think i think the man was maybe twenty five years too early so let's do it thank you",
