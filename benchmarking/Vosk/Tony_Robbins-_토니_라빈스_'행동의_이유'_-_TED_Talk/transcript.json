  "text": "i have to tell you i'm both challenge and excited my excitement is get a chance to give something back my challenge is the shortest seminar usually do as fifty hours i'm not exaggerating i do weekends and what i do i do you have more than that obviously coach people but i'm into immersion because had to learn language you didn't learn it by just learning principles you got in it and you did it so often that it became real and the bottom line of why i'm here besides being crazy mofo is that i'm really into position i'm not here to motivate you obviously you don't need that a lot of times that's what people think i do and it's the furthest thing from it what happens though as people say tomorrow i'm going to be motivation and i said well that's interesting as know what i do i'm the why guy i don't know why you do what you do what is your motive for action what is it that drives you and your life today not ten years ago are you running the same pattern because i believe that the invisible force of internal drive activate is the most important thing in the world i'm here because i believe emotion is the force of life all of us here have great my mine's and you know most of us here great minds a i don't have another category but we all know how to think what our minds we can rationalize anything we can make anything happen we can i agree with what was described a few days ago but this idea that people work in their self interest but we all know that that's bullshit at times you don't work in your self interest all the time because when emotion come he's into at the wiring changes in the way it functions and so it's wonderful for us to think intellectually about how the life of the world is and specially those are very smart we can play this game and our head but i really want to know what's driving you don't know what i'd like to maybe invite you to do by the into this talk is explore where you are today for two reasons one so that you can contribute more and to so that hopefully we can not just understand other people more but maybe appreciate them more and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face in our society today they're only going to get magnified by the very technology that's connecting it's because it's making us intersect in that intersection doesn't always create the view of everybody now understands everybody and everybody appreciates everybody so i've had an obsession basically for thirty years and that obsession has been what makes the difference in the quality of people's lives what makes a difference in their performance because that's what i got hired to do i'm going to produce a result now that's what i've done for thirty years i get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on of course and i gotta do something right now i get the resulting nothing matters i get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide i'm going to some right now and and twenty nine years i'm very grateful tell you have never lost one and twenty nine years doesn't mean i won't some day but i'm done it and the reason as an understanding of these human need someone to talk to you about so when i get those calls about performance that's one thing i can you make a change but also i'm looking to see what is it that shaping that person's ability to contribute to do something beyond themselves so maybe the real question is you know i look at life and say there's to master lessons one is there's the science of achievement which almost every there's rumors master to an amazing damn that's how do you take the invisible make it visible right i you take what you dream and make it happen whether it be your business your contribution society money whatever it is for your your body your family but the other less than of life that is rarely mastered the art of film cause science is easy right we know the rules you write the code you follow and you get the result once you know the game you this you know you up the ante don't you but when it comes to fulfillment that's an art and the reason is it's about appreciation and it's about contribution you can only feel so much by yourself so i'd have an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question which is what's that grunts and somebody's life if you look at somebody like those people that you've given everything to like the all the resources they say they need you gave another one hundred all computer you get the best computer you didn't love you gave enjoy your there to comfort them and those people very often and you know some of them i'm sure enough the rest of their live on always love education money a background spending the life going in and out of rehab and then you meet people that have been to ultimate pain psychologically sexually spiritually emotionally abused and not always but often they become some of people to contribute the most a society so the question we're going to ask ourselves really is what is it what is that the shapes us and we live in a therapy culture most of us don't do that but the cultures therapy from what i mean by that is the mindset that we are passed and everyone in this room you wouldn't be in this room have you bought that theory but the most a society thinks biography his destiny the past equals the future and course it does if you live there but what people in this room know and what we have to remind ourselves that because you can know something intellectually you can know what to do and the not use it not apply it so really we going to ourselves his decision is the ultimate power that's what it really is now when you ask people you know have you failed to achieve something how many have ever failed to achieve something significant you live say i thanks for the interaction on a high level there but if you if you ask people why didn't you achieve something somebody who's working for you you know or a partner or even yourself and you failed to achieve a goal what's the reason people say they failed to achieve what do they tell you don't have a didn't know enough didn't have the knowledge didn't have money didn't have the time didn't have the technology you know i don't have the right manager didn't have a supreme court and and what are those including the supreme court have in common there are claim to you missing resources and they may be accurate you may not have the money you may not have the supreme court but that is not the defining factor and you correct me if i'm wrong the defining factor is never resources it's resourcefulness and what i mean specifically about than just some phrase is if you have emotion human emotion something that i experience from you day before yesterday and a level that is as profound as i've ever experienced and if you communicate with that emotion i believe you would beat his ass and one but how easy for me to tell him what he should do idiot robbins but i know when we watch the debates when we watch the debate at that time there were emotions that block people's ability get this man's intellect and capacity and the way they came across the some people that that because i know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't and i'm was upset but there was a motion that was there when you know what i'm talking about your say i so emotion is it if we get the right emotion we can get ourselves to do anything we can get through it if you're creative enough playful enough fund enough can you get through to anybody yes or no if you don't have the money but your creative are determined up you find the way so this is the ultimate resource but this is not the story that people tell us write the story people tell us is a bunch of different stories they tell us we're not the resource says but ultimately if you take a look here flip it up if you what i say whatever the reason they haven't conway said that next one place he's broken my pattern that son of a bitch but i appreciate of the energy i'll tell you that what determines your resources we set decision shape destiny which is my focus here if decision shape destiny what determines it has three decisions what are you going to focus on right now you have to seibert going to focus on in the second consciously or unconsciously the many decided to focus on something got to give it a meaning and whatever that meaning as produces a motion is this the end or the beginning is got punishing me or awarding me or is this the roll the dice and emotion didn't creates what we're going to do or the action so think about your own life the decisions that have shaped your destiny and that sounds really heavy but in the last five or ten years fifteen years hundred and some decisions you made that you've made a different decision your life would be completely different how many good big of on honestly better or worse say i so the bottom line is maybe it was where to go to work and you met the love of your life there maybe was a crew to there's and i know that google geniuses i saw here i mean i understand that their decision was to sell their technology at first what of they made that decision vs to build their own culture how would the world be different how their lives be different their impact the history of our world is these decisions when a woman stands up and says no i won't go to the back of the bus she and just affect her life that decision shaped our culture or someone standing in front of a tank or being in a position like aren't lance armstrong and someone says to you you got testicular cancer that's pretty tough for an email specially if you ride a bike you got in your brain you got in your lungs but what was his decision of what to focus on different the most people wouldn't mean it wasn't the end it was the beginning what i'm going to do he goes off and wins seven championships he never once once before the cancer because he got emotional fitness psychological strength that's the difference in human beings that i've seen of three million i've been around because that's what my lab i've had three million people from eighty different countries that i've had a chance to interact with over the last twenty nine years and after while patterns become obvious you see that south america and africa maybe connect and a certain way right how do people say oh that sounds ridiculous it's simple so what shape lance what shapes you to invisible force very quickly one state we all have had times if you the time you did something and after the about yourself i can't believe i said that accumulated debt that it was so stupid who's been there's the i have you done some have to do you do that was me it wasn't your ability was your state your model of the world is what shapes you long term your mother world is the filter that's what's shaping that's that's what makes people make decisions we want to influence somebody i to know what already influences them and it's made about three parts i believe first what's your target what are you after which i believe not your desires you can get your desires of goals how many were going to go to zion thought is this all there is somebody been there's a i so it's needs we have i believe there six human needs second once you know what the target that's driving us and then you uncover it for the truth you know form it you uncover it that you find out what's your map what's the belief systems that are telling you how to get those needs somebody will be going to get those needs is destroy the world some people's to build something create something love someone and then there's the fuel you pick so very quickly six needs me tell you what they are first want certainty now these are not goals are designed these are universal everyone needs certainty that they can avoid pain police be comfortable now how do you get control everybody develop a skill give up some a cigarette if you've got totally certain ironically even if we all need that like you're not certain about your help or your children or money you don't think i'm i'm actually not sure the ceilings going to hold up there wasn't any speak but what we go for certain you differently if we get total certainty we get what would you feel if you're certain you know what's going to happen one's is going to happen how it's going to happen when would you feel bored out of your mind so god in her infinite wisdom davis a second human need which is uncertainty we need variety we need surprised how many of you here love surprises say i talk shit you like a surprises you want the ones you don't want you call problems but you need them so varieties important have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen was done this get a fucking life while you're doing it you're so that's good because you read it before saw it before but you're hoping it's been long enough you forgotten up there's variety third him in a clinical significance we all need to feel important special unique you can get it by making more money you can do it by being more spiritual you can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and hearing in places humans don't want to know whatever it takes the fastest way to do this we have no background or culture know belief in resources or resourcefulness is violence if i put a gun to your hadn't i live in the hood instantly i'm significant zero to ten how i ten how certain are mind you can respond to me ten how much uncertainty who knows what's gonna happen next kind of exp citing like climate up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there total variety and uncertainty and it's significant isn't it true want to risk your life for it so that's why violence has always been around will be around us we have a consciousness change as a species that you can get significance a million ways but to be significant year to be unique and different here's what we really need connection a for we all want to most people settle for connection just loves to scary don't want to get her who your was ever going to hurt in an intimate relationship say i if you don't raise your hand you a lot about other ship to come on and you're going to get hurt again and i'm sure glad you came to this positive visit but here's what's true we need it we can do it to intimacy true friendship through prayer to walking and nature if nothing else works for you get a dog don't get a cat get a dog as if you leave for two minutes it's like you've been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later at now these first for needs every human finds a way to me even if you lie to yourself you need to split personalities but the last two needs the first for needs are called the needs of the personalities want to call so as to or the needs of the spirit and this is where film comes you will get fulfillment in the first for you'll figure a way smoke drink do whatever meet the first for the last two number five you must go we all know the answer if you don't grow you what relationships not growing of a business has not grown if you're not going to know how much money you have any friends you have how many people love you you feel like out and the reason we grow i believe so we have something to give a value because the six need to contribute beyond on ourselves because we all know corneas that sounds secret living giving we all know life's not about me it's about why we this culture knows that this room knows that it's exciting when you see nikos if you're talking about us hundred dollar computer the most passionate exciting things here's a genius but he's got a calling now you can feel the difference in it and is beautiful and that calling can touch other people and my own life my life was touch because when i was eleven years old thanksgiving no money no food and when i going to star but my father was totally messed up my mom was letting him know about he messed up and somebody came to do want to live with food my father may three decisions i know what they were briefly hits focus was this is charity what does it mean i'm worthless what i'm going to do leave my family which he did the time when it was painful experiences a life my three decisions gave me a different path i said focus on there's food what a concept of second but this is what changed my life is what shape me as a human be somebody is gift only know who it is that my father always said no one gives a shit and also and somebody i don't know they're not asking for this giving or family food looking out for us it made me believe this wasn't mean that strangers care and what that made me to size strangers care about me and my family i care about them warming to doom and i'm going to just make a difference so when i was seventeen i went out one day and thanksgiving i was my target for years have enough money for to families most fun thing i've done my life most moving the next year i did for and i didn't tell anybody was doing next year eight i wasn't doing for brownie points but after a lot about shit i could use some help so sure enough i went out and on what i do i got my friends involved in i grew companies and eleven companies and i to foundation now eighteen years later i'm proud to tell your last year we've had two million people thirty five countries there are foundation all during the holidays thanksgiving christmas and all of them to countries around here so i don't tell you how to brag it's because i'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it not talk about so finally i'm bad at a time to the target that shapes you here's what's different about people we have the same needs but are you a certainty freak is that what you value most or uncertainty there's main here couldn't be a certainty for you could decline those to those cakes are you driven by significance or lot we all need all six but whatever your lead system is till you in a different direction and as you move into direction you have a destination or destiny the second piece is the map think of that is the operating system tells you how to get there and some people's map years i'm going to save lives even if i die for other people and their a fireman somebody else as i'm going to kill people to do it they're trying to meet to see needs of significance right they want to honor god or another family but they have a different map and there are seven different beliefs to can't go to them because i'm done the last piece is a motion i say one of the parts of the map was like time some people's idea of a long time is one hundred years somebody else as is three seconds which is what i have and the last one i've already mentioned that tells you if you got a target and you got a map and let's say i can't use google because i love max and they haven't made it good for actually so of use map quest how many have made this fatal mistake of using map quest that sometimes use this thing and you don't get they will imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go last thing is emotion now here's what i say about emotion there are six thousand and emotions that we all have words for the english language was just that a linguistic representation right to changes my language but if your dominant emotions if i don't have more time i've twenty thousand people or thousand and i am write down all the emotions that they experience and an average week and again as long as they need and on one side or and empowering emotions the others disempowering just how many emotions people experience less than twelve and a half of those make them feel like shit so they got five or six good frickin feelings right it's likely to happy happy excited oh shit frustrated frustrated over one depressed how many you know somebody who no matter what happens finds a way to get pissed off and we know something like that ornamental what happens no matter what happens they find a way to be happier excited how many wasn't going this come up one nine one one happened all finished with this i was in hawaii i was with two thousand people from forty five countries were translating four languages simultaneously for program that was conducting for a week the night before was called emotional mastery i got up have no plan for this and i said we analysts fireworks i do crazy shit fun stuff and then at the and i stopped i have this planet was gonna say but i never do it i going to say and also nice and when do people really start to live when they faced death and then what this whole thing about if you were going to get off the silent if nine days and now you're going to die who would you call what would you say what did you do one woman or that night is when i'm going to happen one woman to come to the seminar and when she came there she or her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered her friend or a new boyfriend wanted to marry her and she said no is so did you leave going to hawaii thing it's over with us she said it's over when i finish that actually called him a left a message true story at the top of the world trade center where you are so i'm going to i love you i just want you to know i want to marry it was stupid of me she was asleep because it was three am for us when he called her back from the top and said honey i can't tell you what this means he said i don't have tell you this but you give me the greatest gift because i'm going to die and she played the recording for us in the room was on larry king live and he said you're probably wondering how on earth this could happen you twice and he said all i can say to you is this must be god's message to honey from now on every day give you all love you all don't let anything ever stop you chief finishers and a man stands up and he says i'm from pakistan i'm a muslim i'd love to hold your hand and say i'm sorry but frankly this is retribution i can't tell you the rest because i'm at a time tens active ten seconds i want to be respectful ten seconds all i can tell you as i brought this man on stage with a man from new york who works in the world trade center because i had about two hundred new yorkers they're more than fifty lost their entire companies their friends marking up their palm pilots one financial traitor this woman made of steel balling thirty friends crossing up and all died and what i did the people that what are we going to focus on what does this mean it was it what are we going to do and i took the group and got people to focus on if you didn't lose somebody day your focus could be how to serve somebody else there are people who are one we got i'm just so angry and screaming yelling they've actually wasn't pretty york she's not an american she doesn't know anybody here i said you always get angry she said yes guilty people got guilty said people got sat and i took these two men and did what i call indirect negotiation jewish man with family in the occupied territories some new york who would have died if it was at work that day and his men want to be a terrorist and made it very clear and integration and happened as on a film which i'll be happy to send you so you can really see what actually happens that of my verbalization of it but the to them now we came together and change their beliefs and miles of world but they work together to bring for almost four years now to various mosques and synagogues the idea of how to create peace and he wrote a book is called my jihad my way of peace so transformation can happen so my invitation to use this explore your web the web and here the needs the beliefs the emotions that are controlling you for two reasons so there's more of you to give cheap to we don't want to do it but i mean give because that's what's going to fill you up and secondly so you can appreciate that just understand that's intellectual that's my but appreciate what's driving other people it's only way or world's going to change god bless you think you have to sort of",
