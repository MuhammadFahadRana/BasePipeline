============================================================

[0:00:05 → 0:00:25] i'm going to present three projects and rapid fire i don't have much time to do it and i want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation the first is what i like to call a hyper rational process it's a process that takes rationality on almost to an absurd level it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call sort of a rash
[0:00:25 → 0:00:32] conclusion to something that conclusion something you see here you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality
[0:00:33 → 0:00:34] the second
[0:00:35 → 0:00:36] segment of the second
[0:00:37 → 0:00:53] it is that this process does not have a signature there is no authorship architects are obsessed with authorship this is something that has editing and it has teams in fact me no longer see within this process to traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out
[0:00:55 → 0:01:01] in a third is that it challenges and this is in this to the length of this very hard to to support why connect all these things
[0:01:02 → 0:01:15] but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility i modern said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic almost anything can happen within them cause that or shotgun flexibility turn turn your head this way shoot you're bound to kill something
[0:01:16 → 0:01:22] so this is the promise of high modernism within a single space actually any kind of activity can happen but as we're seeing
[0:01:23 → 0:01:40] operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters and so with this sort of idea what happens is whatever actually is in the building an opening day or whatever seems to be most immediate need starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it have anything else could ever happen
[0:01:41 → 0:01:44] so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility something we call
[0:01:45 → 0:01:58] compartmentalize fret flexibility and the ideas that you with the next continuum identify a series of points he designed specifically to and they can be pushed off center a little bit but the and you actually still get as much of that original spectrum
[0:01:59 → 0:02:03] as you originally had hoped with high modernist flexibility that doesn't really work
[0:02:04 → 0:02:22] i'm going to talk about going sort of build up to seattle central library in this way before your eyes and about five or six diagrams and i truly mean this is the design process of josee with the library staff and the library board we settled on to core positions this is the first one and this is showing of the last nine hundred years the evolution of the book and other technologies
[0:02:24 → 0:02:43] this diagram was are sort of position piece about the book in our position was books are technology that something people forget but it's a form of technology that will have to share it's dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media the second premise and this was something was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of it first is that lie
[0:02:43 → 0:02:57] bruce since the inception of carnegie library tradition and americans had a second responsibility and that was for social roles and now this come back to later something actually the librarians of for said no this isn't or mandate or mandate is
[0:02:58 → 0:02:59] media and particularly the book
[0:03:01 → 0:03:04] so if you're seeing now is actually the design of the building the upper diagram
[0:03:05 → 0:03:13] is what we had seen and a whole host of contemporary libraries that used hi modernist flexibility it's sort of any activity could happen anywhere
[0:03:13 → 0:03:27] we don't know that future the library don't know the future the book and so will use this approach and what we saw were buildings that were very generic and worse now and we see buildings that were very generic so not only was the reading room look like the coffee room look like the magazine area
[0:03:28 → 0:03:48] but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment we're starting to do in golf every other activity there was happening in it and in this case or was getting and goal for the social responsibilities by the expansion of the book and so we propose with that the lower diagram very dumb approach simply compartmentalize put those things who's evolution we could produce
[0:03:48 → 0:04:01] yeah can i don't mean that we could say what it will actually happen in the future but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what it would happen in the future but those in boxes designed specifically for it and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops so that was the core idea
[0:04:02 → 0:04:15] now we had to convince the library that social roles was equally important to media in order to get them to accept this what you're seeing here is actually their program on the left that's as it was given to us in all of it's clarity and glory
[0:04:16 → 0:04:36] the our first operation was to read digested or back to them show it to them and so you know it we haven't touched it but only one third of your own program is dedicated to median books two thirds of it has already dedicated that's the white band below the thing you say it isn't important is already dedicated to social functions so once we hit presented that back to them they ago
[0:04:36 → 0:04:52] read that this sort of core concept could work we got the right go back to first principles that's the third diagram we recombine everything then we started making new decisions were just seeing in the right is the design of the library specifically in terms of square footage on the left of that diagram here you see it
[0:04:53 → 0:05:10] a series of five platforms sort of combs collective programs and on the right of the more indeterminate spaces things like reading rooms because evolution and twenty thirty forty years we can't predict that literally was the design of the building they signed it into to the chagrin we came back a week later and we press because i didn't them this
[0:05:11 → 0:05:31] and as you can see it is literally the diagram in the right okay we just sized have a hernia i mean that literally the things in there on the left hand sort of the diagram we're the those are the boxes we size them into five compartments or super efficient we had a very low budget to work with we pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships the reading room should be ah to see the water
[0:05:31 → 0:05:37] the main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code and so forth
[0:05:38 → 0:05:48] so you see the five platforms as of the boxes within each one a very discreet thing is happening the area between a sort of an urban continuum these things that we can't predict the revolution to the same degree
[0:05:49 → 0:05:59] to give you some sense of the power of this idea the biggest bought block is what we call the book spiral is literally built and varying and inexpensive way it is a parking garage for books
[0:05:59 → 0:06:04] it just so happens to be under six to ten floor of the building but that is not necessarily inexpensive
[0:06:05 → 0:06:12] approach and it allows us to organized entire dewey decimal system on one continuous run no matter how it could grow as or contracts with in the building
[0:06:13 → 0:06:15] always have it's clarity
[0:06:15 → 0:06:18] to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced and
[0:06:21 → 0:06:25] and so this is the final operation which has to take these blocks is that raul pushed off kilter
[0:06:26 → 0:06:40] and to hold onto them with the skin that skin serves double duty again for economics one it is the lateral stability for the entire building it's a structural elements and it but it's dimensions are designed not only for structure but also for holding on every piece of glass
[0:06:41 → 0:06:53] the glass was then also use the word impregnated but had a layer of metal that was call stretched metal metal acts as a micro liver so if the next year the building the sun is it is totally opaque for from the interior it's entirely transparent
[0:06:54 → 0:06:57] so now i'm going to take you on a tour of the building
[0:06:58 → 0:07:04] see if i can find it for anyone who is gets motion sickness or apologize so this is the building
[0:07:07 → 0:07:15] and i think what's important when we first unveiled the building the public thought saw it as being totally about our women eager
[0:07:15 → 0:07:24] and it was defended believe it or not by the librarians they say look we don't know what it is but we know it's everything that we need to be based on the observations that we've done about the program
[0:07:28 → 0:07:33] they're going into one of the injuries so it's an unusual building for a public library of his thing
[0:07:37 → 0:07:54] so now we're going into what we call the reading room as our living room this is actually a program that we invented with a library or is recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space there are plenty of shopping malls and allow you to get out of the rain and in downtown seattle but there are not so many
[0:07:54 → 0:08:06] ii free places that allows you to get into the ring so this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything including eat yale play chess and so for now we're moving up into recall
[0:08:07 → 0:08:12] mixing chamber that was the main sort of technology area in the building and to tell me if i'm going too fast for you
[0:08:17 → 0:08:18] and now up
[0:08:24 → 0:08:28] this is actually the place that we put into the buildings like a proposed to my wife there
[0:08:31 → 0:08:32] she said yes
[0:08:36 → 0:08:40] i'm running out of times i'm actually going to stop i can show this to you later but
[0:08:41 → 0:08:46] spec can very quickly get into the book spiral because i think it's as i said the most this is the main reading room
[0:08:47 → 0:08:48] the most unique part of the building
[0:08:50 → 0:08:51] you dizzy yeah
[0:08:52 → 0:08:54] go to hear this is the books bookstore
[0:08:54 → 0:09:04] he's very into sir indiscernible but it's actually a continuous stare stepping
[0:09:05 → 0:09:09] as you to and one city block go up one four floors that is on a continuum
[0:09:15 → 0:09:17] i'm going to go back a certain that hit as second project
[0:09:18 → 0:09:38] go very very quickly through this and this is this dallas theater was an unusual client for us because they came to us and they said we need you to do new building we've been working in a temporary space for thirty years but because of that temporary space we become an internist theater company theaters really focused in new york chicago and seattle
[0:09:38 → 0:09:40] that exception of the dallas theater company
[0:09:41 → 0:10:01] and the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for beckett they could blow out a wall they could do cherry orchard and blow a hole through the floor and so forth so it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand new building that could keep the this or be a pristine building but keep this kind of experimental nature the second as they were what we call a form theater
[0:10:01 → 0:10:15] who different kinds of performances in repertory so they are in the morning or do something in arena and of do something and presidium is so forth and so they needed to be ah other quickly transform between different theater organizations and for operational budget reasons
[0:10:16 → 0:10:21] this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multiforme theater in the united states so we needed if you're in a way to overcome that
[0:10:23 → 0:10:42] so i thought was to literally put the theater on it's head to take those things that have previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them but house and below house and to create so we started a call theater machine we invest the money and the operation of the building so mrs that the building could be placed anywhere wherever you place it the area underneath it is charged for theatrical performances and it for
[0:10:43 → 0:10:48] lot of to go back to first principles and redefine fly tower acoustic enclosure light and closure and so forth
[0:10:49 → 0:10:55] and out of the push of a button that allows the artistic director to move between presidium thrust in fact arena
[0:10:56 → 0:11:08] and traverse and flat for in a very quick to transfer group of transfiguration so in fact we can go using operational budget we can sort of capital costs can actually achieve what was not no longer achievable an operational costs
[0:11:09 → 0:11:29] and i'm is that the artistic director now has a pallet that he or she can choose from between a series of forms in a series of processions because that enclosure on the theater that is normally trapped with front of house and back of our spaces has been liberated so and artistic director has the ability to show had a performance that enters into wagnerian procession shows the
[0:11:29 → 0:11:33] first first act and thrust the intermission and a greek procession
[0:11:34 → 0:11:36] second act in arena and so forth
[0:11:36 → 0:11:43] so i'm going to show you what where this actually means this is the theater up close any portion around the theater actually can be open discreetly
[0:11:46 → 0:11:52] the light enclosure can be lifted separate sub you can kristic enclosures you can do beckett with dallas is the backdrop
[0:11:53 → 0:12:01] portions can be open so you can hours they have motorcycles drive directly into the performance or you can you just have an open your performance or for intermissions
[0:12:02 → 0:12:06] the balconies all moved to go between those configurations but they also disappear
[0:12:07 → 0:12:08] the presidium line can also disappear
[0:12:09 → 0:12:22] you can bring enormous objects in so in fact they're the dell state or company of show will be played by charles lindbergh and they'll want to bring in real aircraft and then it also provides them in the off season the ability to actually
[0:12:24 → 0:12:26] rent out their space for entirely different things
[0:12:27 → 0:12:29] this is it at night grocery from a distance
[0:12:32 → 0:12:36] open up entire portions for different kinds of events and at night
[0:12:38 → 0:12:39] again
[0:12:39 → 0:12:42] remove the light enclosure keep the acoustic composure
[0:12:43 → 0:13:03] this is a monster trucks year i'm going to show now the last project this also wasn't unusual client the inverted the whole idea of development the came to us and he said unlike normal developers and they said we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville that's our main goal and so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money they saw
[0:13:03 → 0:13:05] ability to be a catalyst in their downtown
[0:13:06 → 0:13:11] the end of fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma so they worked in reverse
[0:13:13 → 0:13:26] and that pro forma let us to a mixed use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the are but it also opened up to news for the art itself to collaborate interact with commercial spaces that actually artist more and more want to work within
[0:13:28 → 0:13:47] and it also have charged s with thinking about how to have something was both a single building and incredibles sort of sub buildings i'm going to this is louis those skyline and i'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project first the physical constraints we actually had to operate on three discreet sites all of them well well smaller than this
[0:13:47 → 0:14:00] as the building read operate next to the new muhammad ali's center and respected we had to operate within one hundred year flood plain of this area floods three to four times a year and there's a levy behind our sights similar to the ones that broke in orleans
[0:14:02 → 0:14:05] have to operate in the high end of the i sixty four corridor
[0:14:06 → 0:14:13] a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites so these restoring to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub
[0:14:14 → 0:14:17] underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines
[0:14:18 → 0:14:23] and there is a pedestrian quarter that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings
[0:14:24 → 0:14:28] and a view quarter because this is the historic district that they didn't want to have struck with a new building
[0:14:30 → 0:14:32] and now we're going to add one point one million square feet
[0:14:33 → 0:14:46] and if we did the traditional thing at one point one million square feet and these are the different programs traditional thing would be to identify the public elements place them on sites now we'd have a really terrible situation a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods
[0:14:47 → 0:15:01] the and then we would size all the other elements that different commercial elements hotel luxury housing office and so forth and dump it on top and we we create something that was on viable infection you know this is called the time warner building
[0:15:04 → 0:15:08] sorry a strategy was very simple just left the entire block
[0:15:09 → 0:15:22] flips and the elements over reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown and make circulation connections and reroute thread so that's the basic concept now i'm going to show you what it leads to
[0:15:24 → 0:15:37] guy seems very formal willful gesture the something derive entirely out of the constraints and again when we unveiled at there were sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement not an architecture is attempting to solve a series of problems
[0:15:38 → 0:15:53] now we think that center zone as i said we have the ability to mix a series of thing so here you can see the deal with this sort of an x ray that the towers are totally developer driven they told us that dimensions the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all of public components the lobbies the bars
[0:15:54 → 0:16:03] everything that different company a different commercial elements would have a combined it in the center in the sort of subway map in the transfers oh and that i would also include the contemporary art museum
[0:16:04 → 0:16:07] that creates a situation like this we have artists who can operate within
[0:16:09 → 0:16:28] and art space that also has an amazing view on the twenty second floor but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close to allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art and so forth and also means of an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool so not forced to always work within the confines of contemporary
[0:16:29 → 0:16:30] gallery space
[0:16:31 → 0:16:45] so how to build this is very simple it's a chair so we begin by building the course as rebuilding the corps we build a contemporary art museum at grade that allows us to have incredible efficiency cost efficiency this is not a high budget building
[0:16:46 → 0:16:56] the moment the course get to middle level we finish the art museum we put all the mechanical equipment in it and we jack it up into the air this is how they build really large aircraft hangers for instance the ones that the did for the a three eighty
[0:16:57 → 0:17:06] finish the course finish the meet you get something that looks like this and i only have about thirty seconds or want to start an animation and more concluded with that
[0:17:11 → 0:17:12] yeah
[0:17:12 → 0:17:20] just ask me that had v theater is under construction and this project will start construction and about a year and finish in two thousand and ten
[0:17:52 → 0:17:55] ah

i'm going to present three projects and rapid fire i don't have much time to do it and i want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation the first is what i like to call a hyper rational process it's a process that takes rationality on almost to an absurd level it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call sort of a rash conclusion to something that conclusion something you see here you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality the second segment of the second it is that this process does not have a signature there is no authorship architects are obsessed with authorship this is something that has editing and it has teams in fact me no longer see within this process to traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out in a third is that it challenges and this is in this to the length of this very hard to to support why connect all these things but it challenges the high modernist notion

later but spec can very quickly get into the book spiral because i think it's as i said the most this is the main reading room the most unique part of the building you dizzy yeah go to hear this is the books bookstore he's very into sir indiscernible but it's actually a continuous stare stepping as you to and one city block go up one four floors that is on a continuum i'm going to go back a

we can go using operational budget we can sort of capital costs can actually achieve what was not no longer achievable an operational costs and i'm is that the artistic director now has a pallet that

act in arena and so forth so i'm going to show you what where this actually means this is the theater up close any portion around the theater actually can be open discreetly the light enclosure can be lifted separate sub you can kristic enclosures you can do beckett with dallas is the backdrop portions can be open so you can hours they have motorcycles drive directly into the performance or you can you just have an open your performance or for intermissions the balconies all moved to go between those configurations but they also disappear the presidium line can also disappear you can bring enormous objects in so in fact they're the dell state or company of show will be played by charles lindbergh and they'll want to bring in real aircraft and then it also provides them in the off season the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things this is it at night grocery from a distance open up entire portions for different kinds of events and at night again remove the light enclosure keep the acoustic composure this is a monster trucks year i'm going to show now the last project this also wasn't unusual client the inverted the whole idea of development the came to us and he said unlike normal developers and they said we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville that's our main goal and so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money they saw ability to be a catalyst in their downtown the end of fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma so they worked in reverse and that pro forma let us to a mixed use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the are but it also opened up to news for the art itself to collaborate interact with commercial spaces that actually artist more and more want to work within and it also have charged s with thinking about how to have something was both a single building and incredibles sort of sub buildings i'm going to this is louis those skyline and i'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project first the physical constraints we actually had to operate on three discreet sites all of them well well smaller than this as the building read operate next to the new muhammad ali's center and respected we had to operate within one hundred year flood plain of this area floods three to four times a year and there's a levy behind our sights similar to the ones that broke in orleans have to operate in the high end of the i sixty four corridor a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites so these restoring to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines and there is a pedestrian quarter that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings and a view quarter because this is the historic district that they didn't want to have struck with a new building and now we're going to add one point one million square feet and if we did the traditional thing at one point one million square feet and these are the different programs traditional thing would be to identify the public elements place them on sites now we'd have a really terrible situation a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods the and then we would size all the other elements that different commercial elements hotel luxury housing office and so forth and dump it on top and we we create something that was on viable infection you know this is called the time warner building sorry a strategy was very simple just left the entire block flips and the elements over reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown and make circulation connections and reroute thread so that's the basic concept now i'm going to show you what it leads to guy seems very formal willful gesture the something derive entirely out of the constraints and again when we unveiled at there were sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement not an architecture is attempting to solve a series of problems now we think that center zone as i said we have the ability to mix a series of thing so here you can see the deal with this sort of an x ray that the towers are totally developer driven they told us that dimensions the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all of public components the lobbies the bars everything that different company a different commercial elements would have a combined it in the center in the sort of subway map in the transfers oh and that i would also include the contemporary art museum that creates a situation like this we have artists who can operate within and art space that also has an amazing view on the twenty second floor but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close to allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art and so forth and also means of an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool so not forced to always work within the confines of contemporary gallery space so how to build this is very simple it's a chair so we begin by building the course as rebuilding the corps we build a contemporary art museum at grade that allows us to have incredible efficiency cost efficiency this is not a high budget building the moment the course get to middle level we finish the art museum we put all the mechanical equipment in it and we jack it up into the air this is how they build really large aircraft hangers for instance the ones that the did for the a three eighty finish the course finish the meet you get something that looks like this and i only have about thirty seconds or want to start an animation and more concluded with that yeah just ask me that had v theater is under construction and this project will start construction and about a year and finish in two thousand and ten ah
