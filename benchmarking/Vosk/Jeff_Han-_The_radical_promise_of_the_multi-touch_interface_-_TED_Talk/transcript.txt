[0:00:03 → 0:00:20] i'm really really excited to be here today that because i'm about to show you some stuff that's just where did the come out of the lab literally and i'm really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to be able to see in person because i really really think this is going to change really change the way we interact with machines from this point on now i'm this is er rip
[0:00:20 → 0:00:40] object the drafting table it's about thirty six inches wide and it's equipped with a multi touch sensor now normal touch sensors that you see like going to a kiosk are interactive whiteboards can only register a kind of one point of contact it as haim this thing allows you to have multiple points of the same time they can use both my hands i can use courting auctions i can just go right up
[0:00:40 → 0:00:43] use all ten fingers of i wanted to know like that now
[0:00:45 → 0:01:04] multi touch something isn't anything isn't completely new i mean people i go button i've been playing around with in the eighties however the approach i built here is actually high resolution low costs and probably most importantly very skillful so of the technology you know isn't isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably it's newfound access
[0:01:04 → 0:01:07] ability what's really interesting here is kind of what you can do with it
[0:01:09 → 0:01:11] and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of that
[0:01:12 → 0:01:13] so let's see
[0:01:14 → 0:01:26] so for instance we have a lava lamp application here now you can see in in i can use both my hands a kind of squeeze together and put blobs get our can inject heat into the system here
[0:01:26 → 0:01:32] or i can pull it apart with to my fingers that's completely intuitive there's no instruction manual the and interface just kind of disappears
[0:01:33 → 0:01:42] the started out as kind of a screensaver after one of the phd students in our lab really rosenberg made but i think it's true kind of true of identity comes out here
[0:01:43 → 0:01:48] now what's great about a multi touch sensor is that you know i could be doing this with as many fingers here
[0:01:49 → 0:02:04] but of course multi touch autumn inherently needs multi user so chris could be out here and interacting with another part a lot of like kind of play around with the here you can imagine a kind of new kind of sculpting tool where i'm kind of warming something of kind of making malleable and and kind of letting a cool down and solidifying the certain state
[0:02:09 → 0:02:10] googles just hasn't been that actors and or lobby
[0:02:17 → 0:02:20] a show you something a little more of a concrete example here
[0:02:21 → 0:02:40] as a thing loads now this is a foot for hours like blocks application can i can use both my hands to kind of interact and move photos around but what's even cooler is that if i have two fingers i of grab a photo and and stretch it out like that really easily fans human rotated effortlessly
[0:02:40 → 0:02:53] i can do that grossly with both my hands or if i can do it just two point two fingers on each from my hands together i grabbed the cameras like and kind of do the same thing stretch it out i could do it simultaneously or i'm holding the stone and gripping another one stretching this i like this
[0:02:53 → 0:03:13] again the interface just disappears here there's no manual that's exactly what you kind of expect especially if you haven't interacted with the computer before now when you have initiatives like the hundred on laptop yeah kind of cringe at the idea that we're going to introduce a whole new generation of people to computing with kind of this sarah mouse and windows pointer interface this is something that i think
[0:03:14 → 0:03:17] is really the way we should be interacting with the machines from this point on
[0:03:24 → 0:03:26] of course i can bring up a keyboard
[0:03:31 → 0:03:34] and i can bring that around put up there now
[0:03:35 → 0:03:54] obviously this is kind of us going to keep but but of course it can reschedule to make it work well for my hands and that's really important because there's no reason and this day and age that we should be conforming to a physical device i mean that's how you felt about things like or aside i mean we have so much technology nowadays that the these these interface you starbucks can confront conforming to us i mean there's so little
[0:03:54 → 0:04:14] all applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interface from this point on this keyboard is i probably actually really the wrong direction to go you can imagine in the future as we developed as kind of technology a kind of a keyboard the kind of automatically drifts as your hand kind of moves away and kind of really it's in total into that space which key you're trying to stroke with your hands
[0:04:14 → 0:04:17] so again isn't as great
[0:04:22 → 0:04:24] i'm a research scientist and while you new york
[0:04:29 → 0:04:37] here's a sample know what kind of i can kind of made these little fans dolls it'll kind of fought remember the stroke the making of course going to with all my hands it's pressure sensitive you can notice
[0:04:39 → 0:04:58] but what's neat about that is again i showed you that to for your gesture allows you to zoom and really quickly because you have to switch to a hand to or magnifying glass tool you can just kind of continuously make things in real multiple scales all the same time like and great big things out here but i can go back and really quickly go back to where i started and make even smaller thing
[0:04:58 → 0:04:59] this here
[0:05:00 → 0:05:02] now this is going to really important
[0:05:03 → 0:05:23] as we start getting to things like data visualization friends and i think we all really enjoyed hans rosling talk and you really emphasize the fact that i've been thinking about for a long time to we have all this great data but for some reason just sitting there were not really accessing up and one of the reasons why i think it is that that is because of things like graphics is is will be helped by things like graphics and
[0:05:23 → 0:05:32] and visualization initial his tools but i also think be part of it's going to be starting to be able to have better interface the to be able drill down into this kind of data while still thinking about the big picture here
[0:05:34 → 0:05:44] missouri and app here this is something called world when it's done by nasa now that's kind of we've all seen google earth this is kind of an open source version of the to their plug ins to be able to
[0:05:45 → 0:06:04] to load and different datasets at nasa's collected over the years but as you can see a new the same to finger gestures kind of go around and go and really seem will say there's no interface again it's really allows anybody to kind of go in and just does what you'd kind of expect you know again there's just no interface your the interface just kind of disappears
[0:06:06 → 0:06:16] i can switch to different data views that's what's neat about this app here are you now really cool they have these hyper special images that are kind of false color it's you can really good for the terming
[0:06:17 → 0:06:18] vegetative use
[0:06:19 → 0:06:20] let's go back to this
[0:06:22 → 0:06:23] whoops
[0:06:23 → 0:06:34] now the great thing about mapping applications it's not really kind of to it's kind of three d so again with with multi point interface you can kind of do a gesture like this same kind of be able to tilt around like the know
[0:06:36 → 0:06:52] it's not just simply relegated to the the kind of to the pending emotion now this gesture that we developed again it's just kind of putting to think it sounds kind of the finding an axis of tilt and i kind of kind of tilt up and down that way that's just something we just came up with on the spot you know it's probably not the right thing to do but it's such the such interesting things you can do with this kind of interface
[0:06:54 → 0:06:57] and it's just so much fun playing around with two
[0:06:59 → 0:07:12] and okay so the last thing i want to show us you know i'm i'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do kind of the with this thing i'm a little more interested in the kind of creative applications we can do with this now here's a simple application here and kind of draw out a curve
[0:07:14 → 0:07:16] and when i close it it becomes
[0:07:17 → 0:07:26] character but the neat thing about this i cannot control points and then what i can do is kind of manipulate them with both my fingers at the same time and you know is what it does does
[0:07:27 → 0:07:34] it's kind of a kind of a puppeteering thing where i can use or as many fingers as i have to kind of draw
[0:07:34 → 0:07:35] and make
[0:07:41 → 0:07:48] now there's a lot of actual math going on under here for this kind of to control this mentioned do a lot to do the right thing
[0:07:49 → 0:08:07] but i mean this is a this this this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh year with multiple control points is actually something that state of the i was just released at siggraph last year but a great example kind of research i really love kind of all this compute power to apply to make things kind of do the right things them and intuitive things to kind of exactly what you expect
[0:08:10 → 0:08:26] so multi touch kind of interaction research is is a very active field right now and hc i am not the only one doing it are a lot of other people getting into it does kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it and i'm really looking for interacting with all the guys are next few days and seeing how it's implied your product fields
[0:08:27 → 0:08:27] thank you
