  "text": "i can't help with this wish to think about when you're a little kid and you all your friends ask you have a genie could ask get give you one which in the world what would it be and am i always answered well i'd i'd want the wish to know have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for well then you'd be screwed because you'd know what to wish for a new to use up your wish now says we only have one wish unlike last year they had three wishes i'm not going to wish for that so let's get to what i would like which is world peace and i know what you're thinking you're thinking the poor girl up there she thinks she's a beauty pageant she's not she's that the ted prize i the hook but i really do think it makes sense and i think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other i've met each other a lot of different people over the years and i filmed some of them from a dot com executive in in new york the wanted to take over the world to a military press officer and qatar that would rather not take over the world if you seen the film control room that was sent out you'd understand a little bit like klaus have you was that's great so basically i would i'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel to meet people in a different way than than that because you can't travel all over the world at the same time and i'm a lot of a long time ago for about forty years ago my mom had an exchange student and miniature show you slides that the exchange student this is donna this is done it the statue of liberty this is my mother and aunt teaching donna how to ride a bike this is done eating ice cream and this is done and teaching my aunt how to do a filipino dance i really think is the world is getting smaller it becomes more more important that we learn each other's dance moves that we meet each other we get to know each other we we we are able to figure out a way to to cross borders to understand each other to understand people's hopes and dreams will make them laugh and cry and i know that we can't all do it change programs and i can't force everybody to travel i've already talked about that to christen amy and they said that there's a problem with this you can't force people free will and i totally support that so we're not forcing people to travel but i'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane and just requires a movie camera projector and a screen and that's what i'm going to talk to you about today i'm i was asked that i speak a little bit about where i personally come from and cameron i don't know how you managed to get out of that one but i am i i i i think that building bridges is important to me because of where i come from my my the daughter of an american mother and an egyptian lebanese syrians father so i am the living productive to culture is coming together no pun intended and i've also been called as an egyptian lebanese syrians american where the persian name the middle east peace corps is so maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together there a way to take the world's with me a way to tell stories visually it it all kind of started that way but i think that i really realized the power of the image when i first went to the garbage collecting village in egypt when i was about sixteen my mother took me there she's somebody that believe strongly and community service and decided that this was something that i needed to do and so i went there and i met some amazing women there there were people who there was a am a center there were they were teaching people how to read and write and get vaccinations against many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage and i began to start teaching their i taught english and i met some incredible women there i met people that live seven seven people to a room barely can afford their evening meal yet lived with the strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities i got drawn into this community and i began to take pictures their i took pictures of weddings and and i and older family members that things that they wanted memories of about two years after i started taking these pictures the the cairo conference on un conference on population and development ask me to show them at the conference so i was eighteen i was very excited it was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there and after about two days they all came down except for three people were very upset i very angry that i was showing these dirty sides of cairo and why didn't i cut the dead donkey out of the frame and as i sat there i i got very depressed i looked at this big empty wall with you know three lonely photographs there were of very pretty photographs and i i was like i failed at this but but i was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs i mean hero i this eighteen year old pipsqueak the nobody listened to and all of a sudden i put these photographs on the wall on there are arguments and they had to be taken down and i just saw the power of the image and it was it was incredible and me i think the most important reaction that i i saw there was actually people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such a difficult circumstances and i think it was at that point that i decided that i wanted to use photography and film to somehow bridge gaps to bridge cultures bring people together cross borders and and so that's that's what really kind of started me off dustin and mtv him and film called startup dot com and then and about about two thousand and talk about music films but in two thousand and three when the war in iraq was about to start i felt i was it was a very surreal feeling for me because before the war started there was kind of this media war that was going on and i was watching television in new york in there seem to be just one point of view that was coming across and it it went from the the coverage went from the us state department to embedded true oops and what people were what what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings and the iraqis would be greeting the americans as liberators and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of baghdad and i knew that there was a completely other story that was that was taking place in the middle east where my parents were i knew that there was a completely other story being told and i was thinking how are people supposed to communicate with each other when they're getting completely different messages and nobody knows what the others being told how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future so i knew that i had to go there i just wanted to be in the center had it had no plan i had no funding i didn't even have a camera the time and somebody bring it there because i wanted to get access to aljazeera george bush's favorite channel and on a place which i was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the arab world and also called the mouthpiece of osama bin laden by some people in the us government so i was thinking and you know this the station that's hated by by so many people has to be doing something right i've gotta go see what this is all about and i also wanted to go see central command which was ten minutes away and that way i could get access to how this news was being created i'm on the arab side reaching the arab world and on the us and western side reaching the u s and when i went there and sat there and net these people that were in the center of it and and sat with these characters i've i met some surprising very complex people and i'd like to share with you a little bit of have that experience of of when you sit with somebody and new film them and you listen to them and you allow them more than five seconds sound bite the met an amazing complexity and the of people emerge business as usual the are iran and the dark between us from offered a job the force dick to change the hundred nightmare to americans as to have that three maybe you are never be able to do it but the i have plans for my children when they finish the high school i will send them to a month study the i would buy you for this study there was a the night they showed the p o w from the dead soldiers out of their shoulder it was firefox american rituals kind of images with muslim is america also really gory images and the showed american soldiers and you know for sure about of war or kolko war and it was for evolving it was absolutely revolting made me sick second my stomach and then what hit me was the night before the some kind of bombing and bathroom and aljazeera has shown images of the people and the and they were equally if not more horrifying them and his were and i remember having seen it in their arms or offs and thought to myself as as gross as at such that's bad and then gone away from eating dinner or something and you know it it didn't affect me as much so the impact that had on made me realize in the i just saw people on the other side in those out of people now sheriff's office address your office must have felt the way i was feeling that night and it upset me on a profound level that i wasn't as bothered has been much the night before it makes me hate war but it doesn't make me believe that were in a world they can live without yet i was overwhelmed by the response of the some for we didn't know whether it would be able to get out there we had no funding for it we were incredibly lucky that it got picked up and only showed the film in both the united states and the arab world we had such incredible reactions it was amazing to see how people were moved by this film in the arab world and it's not really by the film by the characters and that gaming josh rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things and when i showed the film and the middle east people said people wanted to meet josh he kind of redefined us as an american population he people started to you know to ask really who where is this guy now analogies are offered him a job hannah and as and near you know on the other hand was was that is also quite an interesting character for the arab world to see because it brought out the complexities of this love hate relationship that the arab world has with the west in the united states i was i was blown away by the the by by the motivations the positive motivations of the american people when when they see this film you know were criticized abroad for feeling like were that were believing where the saviors of the world in some way but but the flip side of it is that actually when people do see what what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad we feel this this power that we need to we feel like we have to get the power to change things and i saw this with audiences who's womanly woman came up to me after the screening and said i'm you know i know this is crazy i saw the bombs being loaded on the planes i saw the military going out to war but you don't under stan people's anger towards us in till you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war and how do we get out of this bubble how do we understand what the other person is thinking now i don't know whether a film can change the world but i know that it starts i know the power that i know that it's star it's people thinking about how to change the world now i'm not a philosopher so i feel like i shouldn't go into great depth on this but show it lets film speak for itself and take you to this other world because i believe that film has the ability to take you across borders and like you to just sit back and experience for a couple minutes being taken into another world and these this this takes these couple clear ips take you inside of to of the most difficult conflicts that we're faced with today as a one hundred had how do you don't know whether or not what's this but i'm going to have an advantage of another is don't know much about something about loving democrats v and it's said the you you're lumping see it as get into most we talk cool with that we've been we've been on them i going to continue with an omelet sydney is the seems to have a lot of him myself had was stoning and of hello the for the going indigenous rossi nice handed to him to hashing and mean even here not much with know the so much now yet

the someone known them and the and the norm that carbon into for him a of of from london and non and we will be muslim should be sure to for those more interest for the scene i'm sure some will mould the moment and a little shalom woman the reviews among us will chew bubble go go go on your whole then the bill who support will what we believe you to was closure muslims are loads a little those who serve him song is something that we communicated with people who otherwise would not he wouldn't a student were coming from europe where you could give him a long political speech the would still don't understand volatility when you finish that song people who below i know unionist i know you guys come from death of to have been the well deliberations run some on those children who took to the streets screaming through nelson mandela it's a mom those during the owners who don't go to demanded freedom is oh boy damn free at all i think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater in a dark room with the other strangers watching a very powerful film and they felt that feeling of transformation and what i'm talking about is what i'd like to talk about is how can we use that pat that that feeling to actually create a movement through film there is i mean i've been listening to the talks and some of this caught that the conference and robert wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity then they will have an appreciation for ours and that's what this is about it's about connecting people through film getting these independent voices our out there now josh rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with aljazeera so here is feeling is that he's in it it's aljazeera international because he feels like he can actually use media to bridge the gap between east and west and that's an amazing thing but i i've been trying to think about ways to to to give power to these independent voices to give power to the filmmakers to give power to to people who are trying to use film for change and they're incredible organizations that are out there doing this already there is witness that you heard from earlier there there's just vision that are working with palestinians and israelis who are working together for peace and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to congress to show that it's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed it and attack and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve there's working films and there's current t v which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their yeah i mean it's it's amazing i've i've i've i watched it on i'm just i'm blown away by it and it's potential to bring bring voices from around the world independent voices from the around the world and create a truly democratic global television so what can we do to create a platform for these organizations to to to create some momentum to get everybody in the world involved in this movement i'd like for us to imagine for a second imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world you have towns and villages and in theaters all from around the world getting together and sitting in the dark and sharing a communal experience of watching a film or a couple films together watching a film which may be highlights a character that that is fighting to live or just a character that defies stereotypes makes a joke sings a song common use documentary shorts this amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together to cross borders and have people feel like they're having a communal experience so if you imagine this day when all around the world you have theaters from around the world and places where we project films if you imagine from projecting from times square to to hear scare square in cairo the same film in ramallah the same film in jerusalem you know we could even use we've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the great pyramid and the great wall of china the there's the the it's it's it's endless the the matter what you can imagine in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience and i believe that this one day if we can create it this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices there isn't a public there isn't an organization with just connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there and yet i'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest danger and our future is understanding the other and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders and if film can do that and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films to get either this could be an incredible day so we've already made a partnership actually set up through a ted somebody from the ted community john came in introduced me to stephen app come from the jacob burns foam center and we started calling up everybody and in the last week there have been so many people that have responded to us from as close as palo alto to mongolia and to india there are people that want to be a part of this global day of film to to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there now we've thought about a name for this day and i'd like to share this with you now the most amazing part of this whole process has been sharing sharing ideas and wishes and so i invite you to give brainstorms on how did that how does this how does this day echo into the future how do we use technology to make this day echo into the future you're so that we can build community and have these communities working together through the internet there was a day there was a time many many years ago when all of the continent's were stuck together and we call that landmass pen jia so what we'd like to call this day of film is ten gs cinema day and if you just imagine that all of these people on these towns would be watching then i think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better at i know that it's very intangible touching people's hearts and souls but the only way that i know how to do it the only way that i know how to reach out to somebody his heart and soul all across the world is by showing them a film and i know that there are independent film makers and films out there that can really make this happen and that's my were so them or stuff i yes i'm close to give you my my of my one sentence west but where where and time god is an incredible wish punjab cinema the day the world comes together it's more tangible than world peace and it's certainly more immediate to but it's yeah it's the day it's it would be the day that the world comes together through film that amount of been gonna die",
