[0:00:00 → 0:00:20] arthur c clarke had a sequel to two thousand and one a space odyssey it's called when he ten odyssey to met the end of it an alien intelligence and burgess jupiter into a star as a group of astronauts narrowly escaped the implosion they received the following message from the aliens all these worlds are yours excel
[0:00:20 → 0:00:23] europa attempt know landing there
[0:00:24 → 0:00:34] now that was just a novel but it suggests that already in nineteen eighty two we suspected that europa might offer our best chance of finding alien life in our solar system
[0:00:35 → 0:00:43] forty two years later in october twenty twenty four nasa is actually launching the most advanced mission to hunt for signs of alien life
[0:00:44 → 0:00:47] and it's going to jupiter's moon europa
[0:00:48 → 0:00:50] there's just one problem
[0:00:51 → 0:00:53] jupiter kills everything around it
[0:00:54 → 0:00:56] so how could life even exist there
[0:00:58 → 0:01:02] and how do you make a probe the can withstand the perilous conditions
[0:01:07 → 0:01:23] deep inside jupiter there is so much pressure that hydrogen is believed to take the form of a metallic liquid and this metallic liquid hydrogen generates an incredibly powerful magnetic field almost twenty thousand times stronger than
[0:01:23 → 0:01:32] earth if you measure at the same distance away so if you could see this magnetic field from earth it would appear twice as big as the full moon
[0:01:33 → 0:01:44] on it's own that magnetic field is harmless but right in the middle of it is the most volcanically active world in the solar system jupiter's moon io
[0:01:46 → 0:02:05] the volcano's on ios surface shootout tons of sulfur dioxide and every second one ton of this material gets ionized and trapped inside jupiter's magnetic field and the field accelerates these particles to rotate incredibly fast with jupiter so they will round over three hundred color
[0:02:05 → 0:02:06] la meters per second
[0:02:07 → 0:02:24] they're inertia actually pulls back on the field stretching it out and this track material slams into other moons objecting even more particles from their surfaces this cycle forms massive radiation belts which spanned past europa and the other moons of jupiter
[0:02:26 → 0:02:45] now for electronics this intense radiation is kryptonite in the nineteen seventies the pioneer ten and voyager missions only briefly passed by jupiter but the radiation caused glitches gave the instruments false commands and corrupted some of their data even with modern shielding a spacecraft within
[0:02:45 → 0:03:06] the radiation belts would only survive for around three months so how will nasa's new mission the europa clipper orbit europa for over four years without getting fried broke the solution is it won't it'll orbit jupiter from afar and then swoop in every few weeks to quickly fly by europa
[0:03:06 → 0:03:26] and then leave again and since the mission is going to collect a lot of data it can use the downtime while it's way out here to transmit it all back to earth before going in for another swoop in all it'll do forty nine fly bys mapping almost the entire surface that's actually how the clipper got it's name after the fast and nimble nineteenth so
[0:03:26 → 0:03:29] entry clipper ships quickly dipping in and out of ports
[0:03:30 → 0:03:34] but of all the places in the solar system to look for life why europa
[0:03:35 → 0:03:47] if you stood on europa surface you'd be hit with fifty four hundred millisieverts of radiation in a single day that's one thousand eight hundred times more than the annual dose here on earth
[0:03:48 → 0:03:55] if you stay here for a couple hours you would eventually die from radiation sickness but europa contains a secret
[0:03:56 → 0:04:07] when voyager one passed by jupiter in nineteen seventy nine it took this photo of europa if you compare that to most of the other moons in the solar system you'll notice something is missing
[0:04:09 → 0:04:20] craters every planet and moon has been bombarded by asteroids over billions of years and most planetary surfaces show it but not europa
[0:04:20 → 0:04:21] so why not
[0:04:23 → 0:04:32] well something recent say over the past sixty million years or so must have been happening on europa to a race most of these craters from the surface
[0:04:33 → 0:04:46] sixteen years after voyager galileo arrived to jupiter it spent eight years studying both the gas giant and it's moons and galileo's magnetometer picked up something interesting on europa
[0:04:47 → 0:04:57] jupiter's magnetic poles like earth's aren't aligned with it's geographic polls so has the planet rotates every ten hours the whole magnetic field wobbles
[0:04:58 → 0:05:05] this changing field from jupiter induces a magnetic field on europa and a relatively strong one at that
[0:05:06 → 0:05:19] that means there must be an electrically conductive layer within europa that reacts to jupiter's field and readings from galileo indicate that it must be somewhere close to the surface only tens of kilometers deep
[0:05:21 → 0:05:24] so what kind of conductive layer
[0:05:26 → 0:05:45] well you is white surface is almost entirely covered in a thick crust of water ice these reddish brown regions when observed through a spectrometer fit the description of a lot of things like hydrated salts sulfuric acid or even bacteria we need more data to be sure but recent experiment
[0:05:45 → 0:05:53] to jpl found that sea salt when bombarded with intense radiation turns from wait to this same brownish color found on europa
[0:05:54 → 0:06:07] so scientists suspect that there's a whole salt water ocean inside europa it could be a hundred kilometers deep meaning europa would contain twice as much water as the whole of the earth
[0:06:08 → 0:06:14] and it must be driving geological activity that constantly smooths out and renews the surface of the moon
[0:06:17 → 0:06:34] but the jupiter system only gets about four percent of the sunlight we get here on earth so europa surface is constantly below negative one hundred and sixty degrees celsius so you'd expect the whole ocean to be frozen solid but there's a way to generate heat that
[0:06:35 → 0:06:39] doesn't rely on the sun and i've got a little demo here prove it
[0:06:40 → 0:07:00] europe is orbit around jupiter isn't a perfect circle this is because i owe europa and ganymede are all in orbit all residents each time ganymede completes one orbit europa completes to and iowa for because of that i owe tugs europa inward on one side of the orbit while ganymede pulls it out on the other
[0:07:01 → 0:07:15] making it's or bit more eccentric now jupiter's pull is stronger on the closer side of the orbit than on the farther side so europa is constantly being stretched and squeezed stretched and squeezed
[0:07:16 → 0:07:19] you can see how this rubber ball gets warmer
[0:07:20 → 0:07:36] as i squeeze it scientists believe that the friction caused by the title flexing of the entire moon can generate enough heat to keep the ocean liquid this effect get stronger the closer you get to jupiter which is why i owe is so volcanically active
[0:07:38 → 0:07:45] so you can see this ball is significantly hotter now i held onto this ball at the same time to make sure it wasn't just the heat coming in from my hand
[0:07:46 → 0:08:03] what sort of temperature the ocean are rethinking such hands on how salty it is so melting temperature of of ice or may be depressed by a ten degrees celsius below that if it's a very salty oh shit similar to
[0:08:04 → 0:08:24] two called oceans on earth and how would the flexing differ if there's this big liquid ocean vs if there's no ocean there if you know ocean europa should flex by only about one meter in amplitude but if there's an ocean in there then it flexes with an amplitude of thirty meters so that's an enormous faction
[0:08:24 → 0:08:45] and that will come out pretty clearly the gravity data another argument for how thick the i shell is we see these very strange features on the surface that are rq it in shape but like multiple arcs put together we can cycle rides and not something you'd expect to see you next movie and we think they form if a crackpot
[0:08:45 → 0:09:05] propagates at just the right speed about the speed someone would walk and is following the changing stress fields of europa being squeezed as it orbits around jupiter and if there were no ocean down there wouldn't be enough of an amplitude of that motion to explain the cracking but if there isn't ocean been critics
[0:09:05 → 0:09:06] plane cracking
[0:09:07 → 0:09:27] all that title flexing pushes magma in the outer core up closer to the sea floor water flowing through the crossed above it is heated and it picks up minerals from the ground ejecting them into the ocean this creates hydrothermal vents and where we find these on earth we also find life
[0:09:27 → 0:09:43] thousands of meters below the surface with no sunlight these vents are a we seize for ocean life the life forms down here rely on unique bacteria bacteria that feed on the minerals from the events rather than from the energy provided by the sun
[0:09:44 → 0:10:04] how long are we thinking that europa has had notion it could be four billion years we don't know for sure that amount of time could give life the opportunity to evolve in those oceans right exactly right organisms can use methane carbon dioxide sulfur reactions any chemical the
[0:10:04 → 0:10:20] then you can think of that might happen in the ocean can potentially be used as a fuel for that organisms metabolism so we're not talking about searching for fishes or whales or squids your something down there but looking for single celled organisms
[0:10:21 → 0:10:32] we were so concerned there might be life on europa that when the galileo mission was ending in two thousand and three it was deliberately crashed into jupiter to avoid the risk of contaminating europa
[0:10:32 → 0:10:42] but clipper will not be able to drill through the kilometers thick ice crust so how are we going to find evidence for a life beneath that the surface
[0:10:43 → 0:10:59] this is this not but it's a drone with petri dishes glued to the top and it flies right through whale blows to collect wales snot right here on earth and zoologist can use this not bought to retrieve all sorts of info on a wales biology
[0:11:00 → 0:11:20] and it turns out we can do something very similar for celestial bodies to we've actually captured images of water geysers shooting out of and sell it is a moon of saturn housing a subsurface ocean and the hubble space telescope has picked up some evidence of what could be similar guys are eruptions on europa no hope is that clipper
[0:11:20 → 0:11:27] i could fly through one of these plumes like this not bought and reveal their chemical composition using a mass spectrometer
[0:11:28 → 0:11:48] but evidence for an ocean on europa isn't conclusive and sell it as seems like a stronger candidate we have actual images of it's plumes and we've even flown through them we are almost a hundred percent certain there's a subsurface ocean there if we have these plumes on and sell it as and there's clearly maybe a liquid ocean
[0:11:48 → 0:12:05] they're wide as europa have your attention more than and sell it as is there is there something that draws year we don't know how long it takes life to get going but it's possible that in sell this may have just started up it's engines
[0:12:05 → 0:12:11] whereas europa more likely been well evolved over a long time
[0:12:12 → 0:12:32] surprisingly being bombarded by jupiter's radiation actually makes europa a better candidate see it was high speed particles hitting europa surface give water and carbon dioxide molecules enough energy to form new compounds like formaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide and these can serve as food for life beneath
[0:12:32 → 0:12:52] the surface if they can get down that far and we have evidence of overturn of the i see show it casts zones where the icy crust seems to have collided in and materials been shoved into the ice shouts and you may be ways for this fuel for life to get down into the icy shell and potentially to the or
[0:12:52 → 0:12:52] ocean
[0:12:53 → 0:12:57] and clipper doesn't have to touch down on the surface to confirm this
[0:12:58 → 0:13:18] there's a infrared spectrometer to look at the chemical fingerprints of light bounced off the surface to help identify and map out where the salts are find if there are organics their their see ultraviolet spectrograph and it's aboard the spacecraft to look for plans are they there and of course then can we fight
[0:13:18 → 0:13:38] rhythm and then novi imaging of a century the whole globe at better than one hundred meters per pixel resolution so one camera will take swaths of images as we fly over the surface and that's called a wide angle camera and then the other cameras the narrow angle camera from fifty kilometers altitude
[0:13:38 → 0:13:58] it will get half meter per pixel images be real below resolve my desk here if it were on europa and then it would be a future mission make a lander that would go and and actually search for signs of life at euro g think a lander would have a chance of survival there have been studies that say we can get a lander living on the surf
[0:13:58 → 0:14:09] as for a month if we think that's sufficient to go in there scoop some stuff up from below the depth of radiation processing and put it into mass spectrometer and see what we see
[0:14:11 → 0:14:30] but the europa clipper won't be studying jupiter's moons alone the european space agency's juice mission or the jugular icy moons explorer is already on it's way to jupiter it will come to the system just fifteen months after clipper and it'll even be doing a few fly bys of europa before settling into a tight orbit around ganymede
[0:14:31 → 0:14:51] so the european space agency you will also mission there at the same time yes we're having informal conversations with members of the do science team what would it mean to have two spacecraft there at the same time the juice mission will end up in orbit around ganymede and ganymede has it's own
[0:14:51 → 0:15:11] make need a sphere well will be outside ganymede magnesium so we might say oh look there's this big burst coming from jupiter and then juice made say oh we felt that are here in our magnetic signals so we wouldn't have to really do anything different except talk to each other when make sure that that some of the of the whole is even
[0:15:11 → 0:15:12] bigger than it's parts
[0:15:13 → 0:15:22] europa clipper was scheduled to launch on october tenth twenty twenty four but nasa is waiting for hurricane milton to clear florida before the spacecraft can take off safely
[0:15:23 → 0:15:43] when will we get the first results you start seeing distant observations coming in in twenty thirty years we look at europe or from afar and search for plumes and then you'll see the first really high resolution data in twenty thirty one so after sept twenty six years of thinking about of miss
[0:15:43 → 0:16:03] one to europa how does it feel to be so close to launch its little surreal us say this has been such a long time coming it's occasionally hitting me that are spacecraft is going to be up there in the heavens rank on it's way it turns out that during a europa osha
[0:16:03 → 0:16:16] conference in the late nineties nasa actually video called arthur c clarke and after showing him plans for a future mission to explore the far away ocean world clerk finally gave nasa permission to land on europa
[0:16:23 → 0:16:42] europa clipper is a perfect example of the amazing things we can do when we set ourselves and vicious goals and then worked together with others to achieve them but i think we often get wrapped up in our everyday lives and forget just how much of an impact we can make on the world that's true on a society wide level like these big international space missions but i also think it's
[0:16:42 → 0:17:02] true an individual level you yourself can probably accomplish much more than you think when it comes to making the world a better place and today sponsor eighty thousand hours wants to help you do just that they are not selling anything eighty thousand ours is a nonprofit that can help you work out a plan for achieving a big positive impact on the world and then
[0:17:02 → 0:17:22] and executing on it career advice typically aims to help you find a job that suits your preferences but what if you really care about helping the world or sure they can tell you to be a doctor or a teacher but these aren't your only options which is why eighty thousand hours have done over ten years of research into how to find a career that does a lot of good and also feel
[0:17:22 → 0:17:42] satisfying they have everything from an indepth career guide to a podcast on the world's most pressing problems and how we can solve them they even have a curated job board with hundreds of high impact career opportunities and everything they provide is free forever so if you want to make a difference with the eighty thousand hours you have to shape your career then sign
[0:17:43 → 0:17:54] now at eighty thousand hours that org slash their it him is a link in the description or you can scan this qr code so i want to thank eighty thousand hours for sponsoring this video and i want to thank you for watching
